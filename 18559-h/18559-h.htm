<h2>FOREWORD</h2>
<p>&ldquo;If youth only knew, if old age only could!&rdquo;
lamented the philosopher. What is the use, say some, of putting
ideas about disease into children&rsquo;s heads and making them
fussy about their health and anxious before their time?</p>
<p>Precisely because ideas about disease are far less hurtful than
disease itself, and because the period for richest returns from
sensible living is childhood&mdash;and the earlier the better.</p>
<p>It is abundantly worth while to teach a child how to protect his
health and build up his strength; too many of us only begin to take
thought of our health when it is too late to do us much good.
Almost everything is possible in childhood. The heaviest life
handicaps can be fed and played and trained out of existence in a
child. Even the most rudimentary knowledge, the simplest and
crudest of precautions, in childhood may make all the difference
between misery and happiness, success and failure in life.</p>
<p>Our greatest asset for healthful living is that most of the
unspoiled instincts, the primitive likes and dislikes, of the child
point in the right direction. There is no need to tell children to
eat, to play, to sleep, to swim; all that is needed is to point out
why they like to do these things, where to stop, what risks to
avoid. The simplest and most natural method of doing this has
seemed to be that of a sketch of the usual course and activities of
a Child&rsquo;s Day, with a running commentary of explanation, and
such outlines of our bodily structure and needs as are required to
make clear why such and such a course is advisable and such another
inadvisable. The greatest problem has been how to reach and hold
the interest of the child; and the lion&rsquo;s share of such
success as may have been achieved in this regard is due to the
co&ouml;peration of my sister, Professor Mabel Hutchinson Douglas
of Whittier College, California.</p>

<h1>THE CHILD&rsquo;S DAY</h1>
<h2 id="Ch_1">GOOD MORNING</h2>
<h3 id="Ch_1_1">I. WAKING UP</h3>
<p>If there is anything that we all enjoy, it is waking up on a
bright spring morning and seeing the sunlight pouring into the
room. You all know the poem beginning,&mdash;</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>&ldquo;I remember, I remember</p>
<p>The house where I was born;</p>
<p>The little window where the sun</p>
<p>Came peeping in at morn.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>You are feeling fresh and rested and happy after your good
night&rsquo;s sleep and you are eager to be up and out among the
birds and the flowers.</p>
<p>You are perfectly right in being glad to say &ldquo;Good
morning&rdquo; to the sun, for he is one of the best friends you
have. Doesn&rsquo;t he make the flowers blossom, and the trees
grow? And he makes the apples redden, too, and the wheat-ears fill
out, and the potatoes grow under the ground, and the peas and beans
and melons and <span class="pagenum"><a id="page2" name=
"page2"></a>2</span>strawberries and raspberries above it. All
these things that feed you and keep you healthy are grown by the
heat of the sun. So if it were not for the sunlight we should all
starve to death.</p>
<p>While sunlight is pouring down from the sun to the earth, it is
warming and cleaning the air, burning up any poisonous gases, or
germs, that may be in it. By heating the air, it starts it to
rising. If you will watch, you can see the air shimmering and
rising from an open field on a broiling summer day, or wavering and
rushing upward from a hot stove or an open register in winter. Hold
a little feather fluff or blow a puff of flour above a hot stove,
and it will go sailing up toward the ceiling. As the heated air
rises, the cooler air around rushes in to fill the place that it
has left, and the outdoor &ldquo;drafts&rdquo; are made that we
call <em>winds</em>.</p>
<p>These winds keep the air moving about in all directions
constantly, like water in a boiling pot, and in this way keep it
fresh and pure and clean. If it were not for this, the air would
become foul and damp and stagnant, like the water in a ditch or
marshy pool. So the Sun God, as our ancestors in the Far East used
to call him thousands of years ago, not only gives us our food to
eat, but keeps the air fit for us to breathe.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page3" name="page3"></a>3</span>In
still another way the sun is one of our best friends; for his rays
have the wonderful power, not only of causing plants that supply us
with food&mdash;the Green Plants, as we call them&mdash;to grow and
flourish, but at the same time of withering and killing certain
plants that do us harm. These plants&mdash;the Colorless Plants, we
may call them&mdash;are the <em>molds</em>, the <em>fungi</em>, and
the <em>bacteria</em>, or <em>germs</em>. You know how a pair of
boots put away in a dark, damp closet, or left down in the cellar,
will become covered all over with a coating of gray mold. Mold
grows rapidly in the dark. Just so, these other Colorless Plants,
which include most of our disease germs, grow and flourish in the
dark, and are killed by sunlight. That is why no house, or room, is
fit to live in, into which the sunlight does not pour freely
sometime during the day. The more sunlight you can bring into your
bedrooms and your playrooms and your schoolrooms, except during the
heat of the day in the summer time, the better they will be. The
Italians have a very shrewd and true old proverb about houses and
light: &ldquo;Where the sunlight never comes, the doctor often
does.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So you see that Nature is guiding you in the right direction
when she makes you love and <span class="pagenum"><a id="page4"
name="page4"></a>4</span>delight in the bright, warm, golden
sunlight; for it is one of the very best friends that you
have&mdash;indeed, you couldn&rsquo;t possibly live without it.</p>
<p>In one sense, in fact, though this may be a little harder for
you to understand, you are sunlight yourselves; for the power in
your muscles and nerves that makes you able to jump and dance and
sing and laugh and breathe is the sunlight which you have eaten in
bread and apples and potatoes, and which the plants had drunk in
through their leaves in the long, sunny days of spring and
summer.</p>
<p>So throw up your blinds and open your windows wide to the
sunlight every morning; and let the sunlight pour in all day long,
except only while you are reading or studying&mdash;when the
dazzling light may hurt your eyes&mdash;and for six or seven of the
hottest hours of the day in summer time. Perhaps your mothers will
object that the sunlight will fade the carpets, or spoil the
furniture; but it will put far more color into your faces than it
will take out of the carpets. If you are given the choice of a
bedroom, choose a room that faces south or southeast or southwest,
never toward the north.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page5" name=
"page5"></a>5</span></p>
<h3 id="Ch_1_2">II. A GOOD START</h3>
<p>When you are really awake and have had a good look to see what
kind of morning it is, you will feel like yawning and stretching,
and rubbing your eyes four or five times, before you jump out of
bed; and it is a good plan to take plenty of time to do this,
unless you are already late for breakfast or school. It starts your
heart to beating and your lungs to breathing faster; and it limbers
your muscles, so that you are ready for the harder work they must
do as soon as you jump out of bed and begin to walk about and bathe
and dress and run and play.</p>
<p>When you jump out of bed, throw back the covers and turn them
over the foot of the bed, so that the air and the sunlight can get
at every part of them and make them clean and fresh and sweet to
cover you at night again. Though you may not know it, all night
long, while you have been asleep, your skin has been at work
cleaning and purifying your blood, pouring out gases and a watery
vapor that we call <em>perspiration</em>, or <em>sweat</em>; and
these impurities have been caught by the sheets and blankets. So
after a bed has been slept in for four or five nights, if it has
not been <span class="pagenum"><a id="page6" name=
"page6"></a>6</span>thrown well open in the morning, it begins to
have a stuffy, foul, sourish smell. You can see from this why it is
a bad thing to sleep with your head under the bedclothes, as people
sometimes do, or even to pull the blankets up over your head,
because you are frightened at something or are afraid that your
ears will get cold. Your breath has poisonous gases in it, as well
as your perspiration; and the two together make the air under the
bedclothes very bad.</p>
<p>Now you are ready to wash and dress. But before you do this, it
is a good thing to take off your nightdress, or turn it down to
your waist and tie it there with the sleeves, and go through some
good swinging and &ldquo;windmill&rdquo; movements with your arms
and shoulders and back.</p>
<p>(1) Swing your arms round and round like the sails of a
windmill; first both together, then one in one direction, and the
other in the other.</p>
<p>(2) Hold your arms straight out in front of you, and swing them
backward until the backs of your hands strike behind your back.</p>
<p>(3) Hold your arms straight out on each side, clench your fists,
and then smartly bend your elbows so that you almost strike
yourself on both shoulders, and repeat quickly twenty or thirty
times.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page7" name="page7"></a>7</span>(4)
Swing your arms, out full length, across your chest five or ten
times.</p>
<p>(5) Swing forward and down with your arms stretched out, until
the tips of your fingers touch the floor.</p>
<p>(6) Set your feet a little apart, swing forward and downward
again, until your hands swing back between your ankles.</p>
<div class="figcen"><img src="images/figure02.png" alt=
"A sketch of a boy stretching" id="figure02" name="figure02" width=
"100%" />
<p>STARTING THE DAY</p>
</div>
<p>When you come back from these down-swings, bend just as far back
as you can without losing your balance, so that you put all the
muscles along the front of your body on the stretch; and then swing
down again between your ankles. This will help to tone up all your
muscles, and limber all your joints, and set your blood to
circulating well, and give you a good start for the day.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page8" name=
"page8"></a>8</span></p>
<h3 id="Ch_1_3">III. BATHING AND BRUSHING</h3>
<p>Now you are ready to wash and dress. You can easily take off the
gown, or garments, that you have worn during the night; but there
is one coat that you cannot take off&mdash;one that is more
important and useful and beautiful than all the rest of your
clothes put together, no matter of how fine material they may be
made, or what they have cost.</p>
<p>Do you remember the old Bible story about Joseph and his
&ldquo;coat of many colors&rdquo;? Perhaps you&rsquo;ve wished you
had one just as nice. Now, the fact is, your coat is more beautiful
even than Joseph&rsquo;s; and, as for its uses, it is the most
wonderful coat ever made!</p>
<p>This coat of yours changes its color from time to time;
sometimes it is pink, sometimes red, sometimes a soft milky white,
and sometimes a dull dark blue, or purple. I wonder if you guess
what it is. Sometimes it is dry and sometimes wet, sometimes it is
hot and sometimes cold, sometimes rough and sometimes smoother than
the softest silk&mdash;just run your hand gently over your
cheek!</p>
<p>Now you have guessed my riddle. This &ldquo;wonderful
coat&rdquo; <span class="pagenum"><a id="page9" name=
"page9"></a>9</span>is your skin, which covers you from top to toe.
It fits more closely than any glove, and yet is so easy and
comfortable that it never rubs or binds or hurts you in any
way.</p>
<div class="figright"><img src="images/figure03.png" alt=
"A drawing of magnified cross-section of sckin" id="figure03" name=
"figure03" width="198" height="204" />
<p>THE SKIN-STRAINER</p>
<p class="morecaption">The little pores open in furrows of the
skin. This drawing is many hundred times as large as the piece of
skin itself.</p>
</div>
<p>Will the wonderful coat wash? Yes, indeed, and look all the
prettier. In fact, to keep it white and clear you must bathe often,
not only your hands and face, but your whole body. Your skin is a
strainer, you know. It is a &ldquo;way out&rdquo; for some of the
gases and waste water from the blood. What will happen, then, if
you don&rsquo;t wash your skin? The little holes, or
<em>pores</em>, that the sweat comes through may become clogged.
The strainer won&rsquo;t let the poison out, and so it will stay
inside your body. Then, too, if you do not wash the skin, the
little scales that are peeling off the outside coat will not be
cleared away. You have noticed them, haven&rsquo;t you, sometime
when you were pulling off black stockings? You found little white
pieces, almost as fine as powder, clinging to the inside of the
stockings. These little scales are always rubbing off from your
skin.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page10" name=
"page10"></a>10</span>So every morning it is good to splash the
cool water all over yourself, if you can, as the birds do in the
puddles. You don&rsquo;t need a bathtub for this, though of course
it is much pleasanter and more convenient if you have one. Pour the
water into a basin and splash it with your hands all over your
face, neck, chest, and arms. Then rub your skin well with a rough
towel. Next, place the basin on the floor; put your feet into it
and dash the water as quickly as you can over your legs. Then take
another good rub. But you must not do this unless you keep warm
while you are doing it, and your skin must be pink when you have
finished. If you are chilly after rubbing, you should use tepid,
even very hot, water for your morning bath. In summer you can bathe
all over easily; but in winter, unless your room is warm, it is
enough to splash the upper half of your body. Once or twice a week
you should take a good hot bath with soap and then sponge down in
cool water. See how the birds enjoy their bath; and you will, too,
if you once get into the habit of bathing regularly.</p>
<p>Now let us take a good look at this coat and see if we can find
out what it is like.</p>
<p>The other day I saw some boys playing basketball. They wore
short sleeves and short trousers. <span class="pagenum"><a id=
"page11" name="page11"></a>11</span>Four were Indians, and five
were white boys, and one was a negro. The skin of the white boys
seemed to shine, it looked so white; and the negro&rsquo;s shone in
its blackness; but the Indian&rsquo;s looked a dull rich dusky
brown.</p>
<p>Yes, you say, they belong to different races.</p>
<p>But what causes the difference in their color?</p>
<p>Little specks of coloring matter, or <em>pigment</em>, which lie
in the outer layer of the skin. Even white skins contain a little
pigment, they are not a pure white. A Chinaman&rsquo;s skin has a
little more of this pigment, so that it looks yellow; an
Indian&rsquo;s has still more; and a negro&rsquo;s has most of all,
making him black.</p>
<p>Sunlight can increase the amount of pigment in the skin. The
people who live in the torrid zone have much darker skins than
those who live where the days are short and cold. You have noticed,
yourself, that when you expose the skin of your face or arms to the
hot sun, you become freckled, or tanned. This tanning, or browning,
of the outer layer of the skin protects the more delicate coats of
skin below from being scorched or injured by the strong light.</p>
<p>When you are playing and running with your schoolmates, you see
that their faces grow very red, and even their hands. Why is this?
Because <span class="pagenum"><a id="page12" name=
"page12"></a>12</span>the heart has been pumping hard and has sent
the red blood out toward the skin. The red color shines through the
outer part of the skin. The pigment in the Indian&rsquo;s skin, or
the negro&rsquo;s, prevents the red blood underneath from shining
through, as it does through yours.</p>
<div class="figleft"><img src="images/figure04.jpg" alt=
"A section of skin showing a folicle" id="figure04" name="figure04"
width="179" height="512" />
<p>THE PARTS OF THE SKIN</p>
<p class="morecaption">The pore P on the surface of the skin is the
end of a tube through which sweat flows out. At O are the oil sacs
that feed the hair H. At B are the little blood vessels that make
the skin look pink.</p>
</div>
<p>The skin, you see, is made up of different layers. When you burn
yourself, you can see a layer of skin stand out like a blister. It
is white; but if the blister is broken, underneath you see the coat
that is full of tiny blood vessels, so tiny and so close together
that this whole coat looks red. The skin, like every other part of
the body, is made up of tiny animal cells. In the outer coat they
become quite flat like little scales and then wear off; and their
places are taken by the newer cells that are growing from beneath.
The skin grows from beneath, and bit by bit it sheds its old outer
coat. This is how it keeps itself nice and new on <span class=
"pagenum"><a id="page13" name="page13"></a>13</span>the outside and
&ldquo;grows away&rdquo; the marks of cuts and burns.</p>
<p>Now hold up your hand and look across it toward the light. What
do you see? It looks fuzzy, doesn&rsquo;t it? Ever and ever so many
tiny little hairs are on it. The other day a little boy asked me
what made his skin look so rough? I looked, and saw that all the
little hairs were standing on end, so that his skin looked like
&ldquo;goose-flesh.&rdquo; It was because he was cold. The muscles
at the roots of the hairs had shortened, so that they pulled the
hairs straight up and made the skin look rough.</p>
<p>What part of the body has a great deal of hair on it? The head,
of course. Isn&rsquo;t it strange that you have such long hair on
the top of your head and none at all on the soles of your feet or
the palms of your hands? The hair on your head protects you from
cold and rain and the hot sun; but hair on your palms, would only
be in the way.</p>
<p>Now look at the ends of your fingers. There the skin has grown
so hard that it forms <em>nails</em>. If you look at your toes, you
will see that the same thing has happened there. These nails are
little pink shells to protect the ends of your fingers and toes.
You see what a wonderful coat it is that you are wearing.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page14" name=
"page14"></a>14</span>Does the skin coat keep you warm? Yes, and
not only that, but it keeps you cool, too. You have often seen
little drops of water on your skin, when you were very hot. This
sweat, or perspiration, as we call it, cools the body by making the
skin moist. You know how cold it makes you to be wrapped in a wet
sheet. Well, the skin cools you in just the same way, when it
becomes wet with sweat. The sweat comes from the blood under the
skin; so that, as we saw before, by letting this moisture pass
through, the skin acts as a sieve to let out the waste from the
blood.</p>
<p>Then, too, the skin covers and protects all the other parts. It
is thin where it needs to be thin, so as not to interfere with
quick movements, as on the eyelids and the lips; and thick where it
needs to be thick, to stand wear and tear, as on the soles of the
feet and the palms of the hands. I remember once taking a sliver of
shingle out of the back of a little boy who had been sliding down a
roof. I had to sharpen my knife and press and push and at last get
a pair of scissors to cut out the sliver. It was just like cutting
tough leather. But even if we do sometimes get cuts and burns and
bruises, yet our skin coat protects us far more than we really
think. It keeps out all sorts of <span class="pagenum"><a id=
"page15" name="page15"></a>15</span>poisons and the germs of
blood-poisoning and such diseases. These enemies can attack us only
through a scratch or cut in the skin, for that is the only way they
can get into the blood. The skin is better than any manufactured
coat, too, because, if it is torn or scratched, it can mend
itself.</p>

<p>READING BY TOUCH INSTEAD OF SIGHT</p>
<p>These boys are blind; their books are printed with raised
letters, which they read by feeling of them.</p>
</div>
<p>Does your skin ever talk to you? No, of course not; yet it tells
you ever so many things. Shut your eyes and pick up a pencil. As
you touch it, your skin tells you that it is round and smooth, and
pointed at one end. You can feel the soft rubber on the other end,
too. Is it wet? No. Is it hot? Of course not. Now place a book in
the <span class="pagenum"><a id="page16" name=
"page16"></a>16</span>palm of your hand. Is it flat or round, light
or heavy, rough or smooth? All these things your skin tells you
through little nerve tips, which are scattered thickly all over it.
Still another thing the skin does; if you touch anything sharp or
hot, it says at once that it hurts. If your clothes are tight or
uncomfortable, the skin soon lets you know. You see it is always on
the lookout, always ready to tell you about the things around you
and to warn you against the things that might hurt you. The fifth
of your &ldquo;Five Senses,&rdquo; the sense of <em>touch</em>, is
in your skin.</p>
<p>There are some parts of your skin-coat that should have special
care.</p>
<p>I hardly need tell you about washing your face carefully around
your nose and in front of your ears. Sometimes I have seen a
&ldquo;high-water mark&rdquo; right down the middle of the cheek or
just under the jaws or chin.</p>
<p>Of course your mother has told you about washing your hands! You
see, our hands touch so many dirty things, and handle so many
things that other people&rsquo;s hands have touched, that we ought
always to wash them before a meal for fear some of the dirt or
germs on them may get into our mouths and cause disease.</p>
<p>And we really need to clean our nails as often <span class=
"pagenum"><a id="page17" name="page17"></a>17</span>as we wash our
hands, for that little black rim under the nail is very dangerous.
Dust and disease germs and dirt of all kinds find it a good place
in which to hide. Trim your nails with a file, not a knife; and
clean them with a dull cleaner, for a sharp-pointed one will scrape
the nail and roughen it, or push the nail away from the skin of the
finger underneath.</p>
<div class="figright"><img src="images/figure06.png" alt=
"A nail file, cuticle scissors, cuticle stick and nail brush" id=
"figure06" name="figure06" width="100%" />
<p>USEFUL TOOLS</p>
</div>
<p>Trim and clean the edges of your nails carefully and thoroughly,
but don&rsquo;t fuss much with the roots of them. That little fold
of skin there may strike you as untidy, but it covers the soft
growing part of the nail; and if you push it back with a
nail-cleaner, it may cause the nail to crack and roughen or become
inflamed and start a &ldquo;hang nail&rdquo; or &ldquo;run
around.&rdquo; If you push it back at all, do so only with the ball
of your thumb or finger.</p>
<p>The edges of the nails should be trimmed in a curve to match the
curve of the end of the finger. Of course you know that you should
never bite your nails, not only because it is a bad habit and will
bring a good deal of dirt into your mouth, <span class=
"pagenum"><a id="page18" name="page18"></a>18</span>but because you
may bite, or tear down into, the tender growing part of the nail,
sometimes called the <em>quick</em>; and then this part may become
inflamed, and you will have a troublesome sore on the end of your
finger.</p>
<div class="figleft"><img src="images/figure07.png" alt=
"A hand with neatly trimmed nails." id="figure07" name="figure07"
width="100%" />
<p>DO YOUR NAILS LOOK LIKE THESE?</p>
</div>
<p>Just as your nails are a part of your skin,&mdash;hardened from
it and rooted in it,&mdash;so, too, are your teeth; and, like the
rest of the skin, they should be kept thoroughly clean. Every
morning and evening at least they should be carefully brushed. If
you take good care of your first teeth and have them filled when
they need it, you will probably have good permanent teeth, and you
won&rsquo;t have to suffer with toothache.</p>
<p>The skin of your head, which grows such beautiful hair, and the
hair itself, should be kept clean. There are two things needed for
this.</p>
<p>First, the hair should be brushed and combed night and morning.
The skin of your scalp is shedding tiny thin scales all day and all
night, just as the rest of your skin is doing. Fortunately,
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page19" name=
"page19"></a>19</span>your hair is growing from roots under the
skin much in the same way as blades of grass grow from their roots;
and, as it grows, it pushes up these scales from the surface of the
scalp to where you can readily reach them with a good bristle
brush. If they are not well brushed out, the dust and smoke from
the air will mix with them, and the germs in the dust and smoke
will breed in the mixture, and you will soon have
&ldquo;scurf&rdquo; or <em>dandruff</em> on your head. So give at
least fifteen or twenty strokes with the brush before you use the
comb. It isn&rsquo;t necessary to brush or scrape the scalp, and a
comb should be used only to part the hair or take out the
tangles.</p>
<p>The second thing is to wash the hair and the scalp. Boys ought
to wash their hair every week; and girls, every two weeks; and
girls, especially, should be careful to dry their hair very
thoroughly afterwards. You will notice after washing your hair that
it feels dry and fluffy, and sometimes rather harsh. This is
because the soap and hot water together have washed out of the hair
its natural oil, or grease, which kept it bright and soft; and this
is why it is better not to wash the hair with soap and hot water
oftener than once a week or so. But it shouldn&rsquo;t be shirked
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page20" name=
"page20"></a>20</span>when the time does come. Watch how hard your
kitten works to keep her fur coat glossy, though it must be
tiresome enough to lick, lick, lick.</p>
<p>Sometimes in cold weather your lips and knuckles crack and
bleed. That is because the skin on those parts is so thin and so
often stretched and bruised. If you will take a little pure olive
oil or cold cream and rub it on your lips and hands, it will make
the skin softer and not so likely to break.</p>
<div class="figleft"><img src="images/figure08.png" alt=
"A row of boots and shoes" id="figure08" name="figure08" width=
"100%" />
<p>SHOES THAT SHOW SENSE</p>
<p class="morecaption">Low heels and plenty of room for the
toes.</p>
</div>
<p>Sometimes your feet tell you that they need better care. Perhaps
your shoes are too tight, or too loose and rub your toes. Soon the
skin becomes very hard in one spot, and you have a
&ldquo;corn&rdquo; on your toe. You must be very, very careful how
your shoes and stockings fit. If you should find a corn, or the
beginning of one, you had better tell your mother about it, and let
her see that your stockings are not too big, so that they wrinkle
into folds and chafe, or that your shoes are mended, or that you
have a larger pair. And then, if you wash your feet in cold water
every day, and put some vaseline or <span class="pagenum"><a id=
"page21" name="page21"></a>21</span>sweet oil on the hard spot
night or morning, the corn will probably go away.</p>
<p>Not only your shoes, but all of your clothing must be
comfortable if your skin and the parts under it are to do their
work well. Your clothes as well as your skin must be washed often,
because the sweat, which is oily and greasy as well as watery,
soaks into them, and the little white scales cling to them, and
often dust and disease germs, too.</p>
<p>One winter a little boy came to my school. The other children
told me they did not like to sit by him, his clothes had such an
unpleasant smell. I talked to him about it, and what do you suppose
he said! &ldquo;Why, I can&rsquo;t bathe; the creek&rsquo;s too
cold in winter.&rdquo; He was waiting till summer time to take a
bath! No wonder the other children did not like to sit near
him.</p>
<p>Yet, with all the bathing and rubbing and brushing, your skin
won&rsquo;t be clean and beautiful and able to do all that it has
to do, unless your stomach and heart and lungs are in good working
order. So you must eat good food, sleep ten or twelve hours a day,
and play out of doors a great deal, if you expect your skin to be
healthy.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page22" name=
"page22"></a>22</span></p>
<h2 id="Ch_2">BREAKFAST</h2>
<p>When you are washed, it doesn&rsquo;t take you long to dress;
and before you have finished brushing your hair, you begin to feel
as if you were ready for breakfast. You know just where the feeling
is&mdash;an empty sensation near the pit of your stomach, and you
don&rsquo;t have to look at the clock to know that it is breakfast
time.</p>
<p>About this time something begins to smell very good downstairs;
and down you go, two steps at a time, and out into the dining-room,
or kitchen. You could do it with your eyes shut, just following
your nose; and it is a pretty good guide to follow, too. If you
will just go toward the things that smell good, and keep away from,
or refuse to eat, those that smell bad, you will avoid a great many
dangers, not only to your stomach, but to your general health; for
a bad smell is one of Nature&rsquo;s &ldquo;black marks,&rdquo; and
you know what they are.</p>
<p>How nice and fresh and appetizing everything looks&mdash;the
white cloth, the clean cups and saucers, and the shining spoons and
forks. You are sure that a good breakfast is one of the best
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page23" name=
"page23"></a>23</span>things in the world. You sit down and begin
to eat, and everything tastes as good as it looks.</p>
<div class="figright"><img src="images/figure09.png" alt=
"A boy moves a milk bottle from a porch." id="figure09" name=
"figure09" width="100%" />
<p>MILK AND SUNLIGHT DON&rsquo;T AGREE</p>
<p class="morecaption">The early riser can help a great deal by
taking the milk bottles in out of the sun. Milk spoils quickly if
it is not kept cool.</p>
</div>
<p>A good breakfast would be an egg, or a slice of bacon or ham,
with a glass of milk,&mdash;or two, if you can drink
another,&mdash;and two or three slices of bread, or toast, with
plenty of butter; and then some cereal with plenty of cream and
sugar, or some fruit, to finish with. A breakfast like this will
give you just about the right amount of strength for the
morning&rsquo;s work. Don&rsquo;t begin with a cereal or breakfast
food; for this will spoil your appetite for your real breakfast.
Cereal has very little nourishment in proportion to its bulk and
the way it &ldquo;fills you up.&rdquo; Bread or mush or potato
alone is not enough. Any one of these gives you fuel, to be sure;
but it gives you very little with which to build up your body. For
that you must have milk or meat or eggs or fish.</p>
<p>It is most important that children should eat <span class=
"pagenum"><a id="page24" name="page24"></a>24</span>a good big
breakfast. All the hundred-and-one things that you are going to do
during the day&mdash;racing, jumping, shouting,
studying&mdash;require strength to do; and that strength can be got
only out of the power in your food, which is really, you remember,
the sunlight stored up in it.</p>
<p>Sometimes, when you come down in the morning, especially if you
haven&rsquo;t had the windows of your bedroom well open so as to
get plenty of air during the night, you may feel that you are not
very hungry for breakfast. Or perhaps, if you have risen late, or
are in a great hurry to get to school in time, you just swallow a
cup of coffee or tea, and a cracker or a little piece of bread, or
a small saucer of cereal. This is a very bad thing to do, because
coffee and tea, while they make you feel warm and comfortable
inside, have very little &ldquo;strength,&rdquo; or food value, in
them, and simply warm you up and stir up your nerves without doing
you any real good at all. A cracker or a single piece of bread or
one large saucer of cereal has only about one fourth of the
strength in it that you will need for playing or studying until
noontime. So after you have started to school with a breakfast like
this, about the middle of the morning you begin to feel tired and
empty and cross, and wonder what is the matter with yourself.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page25" name=
"page25"></a>25</span>Children of your age are growing so fast that
they need plenty of good, wholesome food. They get so hungry that
they want to be eating all the time. For &ldquo;grown-ups&rdquo;
three times a day is enough; but for you children, whose bodies use
up the food so fast, it is well to take also a piece of bread and
butter, or two or three cookies, or a glass of milk with some
crackers, in the middle of the morning and again about the middle
of the afternoon. It will not hurt your appetite for dinner or
supper, and you won&rsquo;t be wanting to &ldquo;pick&rdquo; at
cake and candy and pickles all day long.</p>
<p>How does eating keep you alive and make you grow? Eating is
somewhat like mending a fire. You put wood or coal on the fire, and
it keeps burning and giving out heat; but if you do not put fresh
fuel on, the fire soon goes out. Just so, putting food into your
body feeds the &ldquo;body fires&rdquo; and keeps you warm, and at
the same time makes you grow. Of course the &ldquo;body
fires&rdquo; are not just like those you see burning in the stove:
there are no flames. But there is burning going on, just the
same.</p>
<p>The food you put into your body must be made soft and pulpy
before it can burn in your muscles. Now you can guess what your
teeth are <span class="pagenum"><a id="page26" name=
"page26"></a>26</span>for. They chop, crush, and grind the food;
and the tongue rolls it over and over and mixes it with the
moisture in your mouth, until it is almost like very thick soup.
Then you make a little motion with your tongue and throat, and down
it goes.</p>
<div class="figleft"><img src="images/figure10.png" alt=
"A diagram of the digestive system." id="figure10" name="figure10"
width="100%" />
<p>THE FOOD TUBE</p>
<p class="morecaption">Note the arrows. This is the trip made by
every mouthful of food.</p>
</div>
<p>Where does it go? It is passed down a tube that we call the
<em>food tube</em>. While I tell you about it, you can look at the
picture and then try to draw it yourself.</p>
<p>The food goes quickly down the first part of the tube until it
comes to a part much larger than the rest, which we call the
<em>stomach</em>. Here it is churned about for a long time, and the
meat you have eaten is melted, or dissolved. Then the food goes
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page27" name="page27"></a>27</span>on
into the next part of the tube, which has become narrow again. This
lower part, which is about twenty-five feet long, is coiled up just
below the waist, between the large bones that you can feel on each
side of your body. These coils of the food tube, we call the
<em>bowels</em>.</p>
<p>Winding all around the stomach and bowels are tiny branching
pipes full of blood. They look somewhat like the creepers on ivy,
or the tendrils on grapevines. These suck out the melted food from
the bowels. They take what the body can use, and carry it away in
the blood to all parts of the body. This is the fuel that keeps the
&ldquo;body fires&rdquo; going. The tougher parts of the food,
which the body cannot use, are carried down to the lower end of the
bowels and pushed out by strong muscles.</p>
<p>This waste should be passed out from the body once every day and
at the same time each day. In the morning after breakfast is
perhaps the best time. If you do not get rid of it every day, it
makes poisons, which go into your blood and soon make you very sick
indeed. You must keep clean inside as well as outside.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page28" name=
"page28"></a>28</span></p>
<h2 id="Ch_3">GOING TO SCHOOL</h2>
<h3 id="Ch_3_1">I. GETTING READY</h3>
<p>As soon as you have finished breakfast, and brushed your teeth
and gone to the toilet, you are ready to run out of doors to play,
if you have plenty of time, or, if not, to start for school.</p>
<p>Doesn&rsquo;t it seem a nuisance, in winter time, to have to put
on a coat and overshoes and a cap or a hood, and sometimes leggings
and mittens, too? But your mothers know what is best for you; and
when you are young and growing fast, you have so much more surface
in proportion to your weight than when you are grown up, that you
lose heat from the blood in your skin very fast; and unless you are
warmly dressed, you become chilled.</p>
<p>When you are chilled, you are using up, in merely trying to keep
yourself warm, some of the energy that ought to be used for growing
and for working. It has been found out by careful tests that
children who are not warmly dressed, and particularly whose arms
and legs are not warmly covered, do not grow so fast as they ought
to, and more easily catch colds and other <span class=
"pagenum"><a id="page29" name="page29"></a>29</span>infections. So
take time to put on your cap and your coat, if the weather is cold;
and, if it is snowy, to button on leggings over your stockings; and
then you can play as hard as you like, and run through the snow,
and keep warm and rosy and comfortable.</p>
<p>Wool is one of the best stuffs for coats and dresses and
stockings and gloves and caps, not only because it is warm, but
also because it is lighter in weight than anything else you could
wear that would be equally warm, and because it is <em>porous</em>;
that is, it will let the air pass through it, and the perspiration
from the body escape through it.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t wear any clothes so tight that you cannot run and
jump and play and fling your arms and legs about freely, or so fine
and stylish that you are afraid of getting them soiled by romping
and tumbling.</p>
<p>It is best to wear fairly heavy, comfortable shoes with good
thick soles; then you will not have to wear rubbers, except when it
is actually pouring rain, or when there is melting snow or slush
upon the ground. Felt, or buckskin, or heavy cloth makes very good
&ldquo;uppers&rdquo; for children&rsquo;s shoes; but only leather
makes good soles.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page30" name=
"page30"></a>30</span>It is best not to wear rubbers too much,
because the same waterproofness, which keeps the rain and the snow
out, keeps the perspiration of your feet in, and is likely to make
them damp. When they are damp, they are as easily chilled as if
they had been wet through with rain or puddle water. Always take
off your rubbers in the house or in school, because they are
holding in not only the water of perspiration, but the poisons as
well; and these will poison your entire blood, so that you soon
have a headache and feel generally uncomfortable.</p>
<h3 id="Ch_3_2">II. AN EARLY ROMP</h3>
<p>The minute you are outside the door, the fresh morning air
strikes your face, and you draw four or five big breaths, as if you
would like to fill yourself as full as you could hold. If you have
had a good night&rsquo;s sleep and a good breakfast, the very feel
of the outdoor air will make you want to run and jump and shout and
throw your arms about. This warms you up finely and gives you a
good color; but if you keep it up long, you will notice that two
things are happening: one, that you are breathing faster than you
were before; the other, that your heart is beating harder and
faster, so that you can almost feel it <span class="pagenum"><a id=
"page31" name="page31"></a>31</span>throbbing without putting your
hand on your chest.</p>
<p>If you run too hard, or too far, you begin to be out of breath,
and your heart thumps so hard that it almost hurts. What is your
heart doing? It is pumping; it is trying to pump the blood fast out
to your muscles to give them the strength to run with.</p>
<div class="figcen"><img src="images/figure11.jpg" alt=
"A photograph of boys and girls holding hands and running down the sidewalk"
id="figure11" name="figure11" width="533" height="362" />
<p>AN EARLY RUN IS A GOOD PREPARATION FOR THE DAY&rsquo;S WORK</p>
</div>
<p>Of course you have seen a pump? Perhaps some of you have to pump
water every day at home. You take the handle in your hands, lift it
up, then press it down, and out pours the water through the spout;
and, as you keep pumping, the water spurts out every time you press
the <span class="pagenum"><a id="page32" name=
"page32"></a>32</span>handle down. It is hard work, and your arms
are soon tired; but, as you cannot drink the water while it is down
in the well, you must pump to bring it up where you can reach
it.</p>
<div class="figleft"><img src="images/figure12.png" alt=
"Anatomical drawing of a heart." id="figure12" name="figure12"
width="100%" />
<p>THE HEART-PUMP</p>
<p class="morecaption">The big tubes are the arteries and
veins.</p>
</div>
<p>Just so the heart pumps to keep the blood flowing round and
round, through the muscles and all over the body. If you put your
finger on your wrist, or on the side of your neck, you can feel a
little throb, or <em>pulse</em>, for every spurt from your
heart-pump; and that means for every heart-beat.</p>
<p>This heart-pump is made of muscle, and is about the size of your
clenched fist. And just as you can squeeze water from a sponge or
out of a bulb-syringe, by opening and shutting your hand around it,
so the big heart muscle squeezes the blood out of the heart. It
squeezes it out from one side of the heart; and then, when it lets
go, the blood comes rushing in from the other side to fill the
heart <span class="pagenum"><a id="page33" name=
"page33"></a>33</span>again. So the heart goes on squeezing out and
sucking in the blood, all day and all night as long as we live.</p>
<p>When the blood comes to the muscles, it is a beautiful bright
red; but after the muscles have taken what they want of it for food
to burn, and warm you up, the &ldquo;ashes&rdquo; and the
&ldquo;smoke&rdquo; go back into the blood and dirty its color from
red to purple. Then the blood is carried to the lungs, where the
fresh air you breathe in blows away the &ldquo;smoke&rdquo; and
makes the blood red again.</p>
<p>The blood is pumped all over the body through tubes or pipes,
called <em>blood vessels</em>. Those that carry the red blood out
from the heart, we call <em>arteries</em>. They are deep down under
the skin, and we cannot see them. The pipes that carry the purple
blood from the muscles and other parts back to the heart again, we
call <em>veins</em>; and some of these are so close to the surface
that we can easily see them through the skin. Let your hand hang
down a minute or two, then you can see the veins on the inside of
your wrist, or on the back of your hand, if it is not too fat.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page34" name=
"page34"></a>34</span></p>
<div class="figfull"><img src="images/figure13.png" alt=
"A photograph of children playing in the snow outside of school."
id="figure13" name="figure13" width="100%" />
<p>IT IS GOOD TO PLAY OUT OF DOORS TILL THE BELL RINGS&mdash;EVEN
IN WINTER</p>
</div>
<p>The muscles, the brain, the skin, and other parts of the body
get liquid food from the blood by &ldquo;sucking&rdquo; it through
the walls of the smallest <span class="pagenum"><a id="page35"
name="page35"></a>35</span>of the blood vessels, for these walls
are very thin. In the same way, when waste passes from the muscles
or the skin into the blood, it, too, soaks through the thin walls
of the tiniest blood tubes, called <em>capillaries</em>.</p>
<p>Your heart beats or throbs about seventy-five times in a minute
when you are well. Look at the second hand of a watch, while you
count the beats in your wrist or in your neck.</p>
<p>Does your heart ever become tired? Not while you keep well,
unless you over-drive it by running or wrestling too hard. It can
rest between the beats. But the heart muscle, like any other
muscle, must have plenty of good red blood to feed on. You put food
into the blood by eating good breakfasts and dinners. The more you
run and jump and play, the more work the heart has to do and the
stronger it grows; and a good morning romp before school will send
the blood flowing so merrily round from top to toe that you will
feel fresher and brighter all the day.</p>
<h3 id="Ch_3_3">III. FRESH AIR&mdash;WHY WE NEED IT</h3>
<p>The heart is not the only thing that goes faster and harder when
you run about in the morning and play hard. You are breathing
faster and deeper as well, as if there were something <span class=
"pagenum"><a id="page36" name="page36"></a>36</span>in the air
outside that you needed in your body as much as food.</p>
<p>But, of course, you know that air is not good to eat. It has no
strength in it, as food has; it isn&rsquo;t even a liquid like milk
or coffee or tea. It is so thin and light that we call it a
<em>gas</em>. Indeed, I suppose it is pretty hard for you to
believe that air is a real thing at all. But all outdoors is full
of the gas called air, and everything that seems to be empty, like
a room or an empty box, is full of it.</p>
<p>You cannot even smell it, as you can that other gas which comes
through pipes into our houses and burns at the gas jets; nor can
you see it like the gas that comes out of a boiling kettle or from
the whistle of a locomotive, and which we call <em>steam</em>. This
is simply because air is so pure that it has no smell, and is so
perfectly clear that we can see right through it. Almost the only
way that we can recognize it is by feeling it when it is moving.
But it is a very real thing for all that; and, like sunshine and
food, is one of the most important things in the world for us.</p>
<p>What is it that air does in the body? We must need it very much,
for we die quickly when we cannot get it: it takes us only about
three minutes to suffocate, or choke to death, if we can&rsquo;t
get it.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page37" name=
"page37"></a>37</span>You remember that the blood is pumped out
from the heart, all through the body. Everywhere it goes,&mdash;to
the feet and the hands and the head,&mdash;it is carrying two
things: food that it has sucked up from the food tube, and hundreds
and hundreds of tiny red sponges called red <em>corpuscles</em>.
These little sponges are full of air which they sucked up as the
blood passed through the lungs. When we stop breathing,&mdash;that
is, taking in air,&mdash;the little red sponges of course
can&rsquo;t get any air to carry to the different parts of the
body.</p>
<p>The body is made up of millions of tiny, tiny animals, called
<em>cells</em>,&mdash;so tiny that they can be seen only under a
microscope. Each of these cells must have food and air, just like
any other animal. They eat the food the blood brings to them, and
they take the air from the red corpuscles in the blood. With the
air as a &ldquo;draft,&rdquo; they burn up the waste scraps, as we
burn scraps from the kitchen, in the back of the stove.</p>
<p>Suppose you light a candle and place it under a glass jar and
watch what will happen. The flame will become weaker and weaker,
and at last it will quite go out. You might think at first that the
wind blew it out; but how could the wind get through or under the
jar? No, the glass keeps all <span class="pagenum"><a id="page38"
name="page38"></a>38</span>the outside air away from the flame; and
that is just the reason why it does go out. Unless it has fresh
air, it cannot burn. There is something&mdash;a gas&mdash;in the
air that makes the flame burn, and when it has used up all this gas
inside the glass, and can&rsquo;t get any more, it stops
burning.</p>
<p>Now you will want to know what this gas in the air is. When we
write about it, we use its nickname, the large capital letter
<em>O</em>; but its whole name is <em>Oxygen</em>.</p>
<p>Just as the candle flame must have oxygen to keep it burning, so
our cells must have oxygen to burn their impurities, or waste; and
if they don&rsquo;t get the oxygen, and can&rsquo;t burn their
impurities, they are poisoned by them and &ldquo;go out,&rdquo; or
die.</p>
<p>You can see the flame when the candle is burning, but you
can&rsquo;t see the fires that burn in our bodies; there are no
real flames at all. I know it is hard for you to believe that there
can be any burning when our bodies are so wet and damp. But if you
can&rsquo;t see it, you can easily feel it. Blow on your hand. How
warm your breath is! Touch your hand to your cheek. It is quite
warm, too. If you run or play hard, you sometimes become so hot
that you want to take off your coat. That is because your fires are
burning <span class="pagenum"><a id="page39" name=
"page39"></a>39</span>faster. The muscles are using more food and
making more scraps to be burned. You breathe faster and faster till
at last you are &ldquo;out of breath&rdquo; and feel as if you
would smother or choke. The blood has hard work to bring oxygen
enough to keep the fires going.</p>
<p>After the cells have burned the food scraps, they turn the
&ldquo;ashes&rdquo; and &ldquo;smoke&rdquo; back into the
blood-stream that is always flowing past them. If the cells did not
do this, they would soon smother to death, just as you could not
possibly live in a house without chimneys to carry off the smoke.
And, of course, the blood wants to get rid of this waste just as
quickly as possible.</p>
<p>Part of the waste in the body is liquid, like water, and can
flow away through the blood pipes without needing to be burned.
Some of this watery waste comes out through the skin and stands in
beads or drops upon it. That is the part we call perspiration, or
sweat. The rest of it goes in the blood to another strainer called
the <em>kidneys</em>, passes through this as <em>urine</em>, and is
carried away from the body as the waste water from the bathtub and
the sink is carried away from a house.</p>
<p>For the &ldquo;smoke&rdquo; Mother Nature has still <span class=
"pagenum"><a id="page40" name="page40"></a>40</span>another
beautiful plan. She sends the blood-stream flowing through the
<em>lungs</em>, where it can send off its &ldquo;smoke&rdquo; and
then get fresh air to carry to the cells in the muscles. When you
breathe out, you are sending out the &ldquo;smoke&rdquo;; and when
you breathe in, you are taking in fresh air.</p>
<p>Our body &ldquo;smoke&rdquo; is not brown or blue, like the
smoke from a fire; it is a clear, odorless gas, called <em>carbon
dioxid</em>. This is the same gas that makes the choke-damp of coal
mines, which suffocates the miners if the mine is not well
ventilated; and the same gas that sometimes gathers at the bottom
of a well, making it dangerous for anyone to go down into the well
to clean it. And this gas is poisonous in our bodies just as it is
in the mine or the well.</p>
<p>You see, then, how important it is that we should live much of
our lives in the clear pure air out of doors, and should bring the
fresh air into our houses and schools and shops. &ldquo;Fill
up&rdquo; with it all you can on your way to school, for the best
of air indoors is never half so good as the free-blowing breezes
outside.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page41" name=

<h3 id="Ch_3_4">IV. FRESH AIR&mdash;HOW WE BREATHE IT</h3>
<p>When you are running and breathing hard, and even when you are
sitting still and breathing quietly, air is going into your lungs
and then coming out, going in and coming out, many times every
minute. How does the air get in and out of the lungs? It will not
run in of itself; for it is light and floats about, you know. Here,
again, Mother Nature has planned it all out. She has made us an air
bellows, or air pump, to suck it into the lungs. First we&rsquo;ll
see what shape this pump is, and then how it works.</p>
<div class="figleft"><img src="images/figure14.jpg" alt=
"Diagram of the chest cavity." id="figure14" name="figure14" width=
"100%" />
<p>THE CHEST THAT HOLDS THE LUNGS</p>
<p class="morecaption">Back of the lungs is the heart; its position
is shown by the broken line. The black line across the chest shows
how high the diaphragm rises when we breathe out quietly.</p>
</div>
<p>Stiff rings of bone called <em>ribs</em> run round your body,
just like the hoops in an old hoop skirt, or like the metal rings
round a barrel. Here is a picture of the bones of the chest.
Perhaps your teacher can show you the skeleton <span class=
"pagenum"><a id="page42" name="page42"></a>42</span>of some animal.
You will notice how the rings, or ribs, slant and are joined by
hinges behind to the backbone and in front to the breastbone. It
looks somewhat like a cage, doesn&rsquo;t it? Put your hands on the
sides of your chest and you can feel your own ribs. Do they slant
upward or downward?</p>
<p>This chest-cage is our breathing-machine. Before I tell you how
it pumps, I want you to get a pair of bellows and see how they
work. When you lift up the handle of the bellows, you make the bag
of the bellows larger so that it sucks in air; and when you press
the handle down again, the air puffs out through the nozzle.</p>
<p>Our air machine, though it is somewhat different from the
bellows in shape, works in exactly the same way. You remember that
you found that the ribs slant down and can be moved on hinges.
Suppose, now, you place your hands against your ribs and feel the
ribs lift as you draw in a long breath. The air will be sucked into
your nose just as it was into the bellows when you raised the
handle. By lifting your ribs, you have made the chest-cage larger;
and the air has rushed into your nose, down your windpipe, and
filled your lungs. If you breathe very deeply, you will find that
your stomach, too, <span class="pagenum"><a id="page43" name=
"page43"></a>43</span>swells out. This shows that the muscular
bottom of the cage, called the <em>diaphragm</em>, has been pulled
down, making the cage larger still.</p>
<p>In this chest-cage are millions of tiny air bags that make up
the lungs; and every time you take a breath, the air bags are
puffed out with the fresh air that comes rushing in. By the time
you let your ribs sink again, the air has given its oxygen to the
blood, and the blood has poured its carbon-dioxid smoke into the
air bags for you to breathe out. Nature, with the same bellows,
pumps in the oxygen and pumps out the &ldquo;smoke.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Now, we breathe into our lung-bellows whatever air happens to be
around us. So we should take care that the air around us is fresh
air.</p>
<p>Unless the air were kept in motion by the heat of the sun,
causing breezes and winds, it would become stale and wouldn&rsquo;t
do at all for our lung-bellows to use. The air we breathe must be
kept moving and fresh if it is to make us feel bright and strong
and happy. Mother Nature has given us miles upon miles and oceans
upon oceans of this clear, fresh air to breathe&mdash;&ldquo;all
outdoors,&rdquo; in fact, as far as we can see around us and for
miles above our heads. She sends the winds to move the air about
and blow away the dust and dirt; and the sunshine, you remember,
not only <span class="pagenum"><a id="page44" name=
"page44"></a>44</span>to warm the air and keep it moving, but to
burn right through it and kill the poisons. But this brings us to
something else.</p>
<p>You have learned that the air we breathe out would soon smother
us, just as smoke would; and now we will see why. If you blow
against the window pane on a cold day, the glass is no longer
clear; and when you look at it closely, you see that it is covered
with tiny drops of water. This is part of the breath you have just
blown out. If the room is cold enough, you can see your breath in
the air; that is, the steam in your breath becomes cold and appears
as tiny water-drops. You have seen how in the same way, the steam,
an inch or so from the spout of the teakettle, cools, making little
water-drops that float in the air like clouds. Part of the breath,
then, is water; but most of it is a gas, and you can&rsquo;t see it
at all as it floats away into the air about you.</p>
<p>If your teacher has a glass of limewater, and will let you
breathe into it through a tube, you will see that your breath soon
makes the water look milky. This shows that the gas in your breath
is not like the air about you; because air was all over the top of
the limewater, yet did not change it at all. The milky look is
caused <span class="pagenum"><a id="page45" name=
"page45"></a>45</span>by carbon dioxid, one of the poisons in your
breath.</p>
<p>When some people come close to you, you want to turn away your
head, because you do not like the smell of their breath. Even when
one is quite well, the breath has a queer &ldquo;mousey&rdquo;
odor, so that we never like to breathe the breath of another
person. This disagreeable odor comes not only from the lungs but
from the teeth.</p>
<p>We are always breathing out poisons into the air. One of these
you can see in the milky limewater, and others you can smell when
you happen to come close to anyone else.</p>

"A girl blows through a straw into a glass of water." id="figure15"
name="figure15" width="100%" />
<p>PROVING THAT THE BREATH IS NOT LIKE THE AIR</p>
</div>
<p>If you blow on your fingers, you feel that your breath is much
warmer than the air. If people are crowded together in rooms with
doors and windows shut, their breath soon heats and poisons the
air, until they begin to have headache, and to feel dull and drowsy
and uncomfortable. If they should be shut in too long, without any
opening to let in the fresh air, as in a prison cell, or in the
hold of a ship during a storm, the air would become so poisonous as
to make them <span class="pagenum"><a id="page46" name=
"page46"></a>46</span>ill, and would even suffocate them and kill
them outright. Even the bees found this out thousands of years ago;
and in their hives in hot weather they station lines of
worker-bees, one just behind another from the door right down each
of the main passages, whose business it is to do nothing but keep
their wings whirring rapidly, so that they fan a steady current of
fresh air into every part of the hive.</p>

</div>
<p style="clear:both;">DUSTING&mdash;HOW SHALL WE DO IT?</p>
</div>
<p>How does Mother Nature get rid of these poisons from our breath?
Of course, you say, &ldquo;She uses the wind and the
sunshine.&rdquo; Yes, the winds can whisk up the poison and blow it
away so fast, and the sunshine can burn up the horrid <span class=
"pagenum"><a id="page47" name="page47"></a>47</span>smell so
quickly, that even the air above big cities, and in their streets,
is quite clean enough for us to breathe, except where the people
are very closely crowded together and very dirty. Mother Nature
wants all of us to help in keeping the air clean. This we can do by
keeping ourselves and our houses clean, and by being careful not to
leave scraps of waste, or dirty things, in the streets and cars and
parks and other public places. And you children ought to be very
careful about your school yard and the halls and the classrooms,
where you spend so much of your time.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page48" name=
"page48"></a>48</span></p>
<h2 id="Ch_4">IN SCHOOL</h2>
<h3 id="Ch_4_1">I. BRINGING THE FRESH AIR IN</h3>
<p>The only place where air is absolutely sure to be fresh is out
of doors. There, as we have seen, the sun and the winds keep it so
all the time. But, unluckily, we cannot spend all our time
outdoors, either when we are little or after we have grown up. So
we must try in every way that we can to bring the outdoors
indoors&mdash;to get plenty of fresh air and light into the houses
that we live in, especially the bedrooms we sleep in and the
schoolrooms we study in when we are children, and the offices or
shops we work in when we are grown up.</p>
<p>After you have your lungs and your blood well filled with air,
either by walking briskly to school or by chasing one another about
the school playground, you will suddenly hear the bell ring, and
you march indoors and sit down at your desks. Here, of course, the
air cannot blow about freely from every direction, because the
walls and doors and windows are shutting you in on every side. The
room, to be sure, is full of air; but if the doors and windows are
shut, this air has no way <span class="pagenum"><a id="page49"
name="page49"></a>49</span>of getting outside, nor can the fresh,
pure air out of doors&mdash;even though it be moving quite fast, as
a wind or a breeze&mdash;get inside.</p>
<div class="figcen"><img src="images/figure17.jpg" alt=
"A photograph of a classroom." id="figure17" name="figure17" width=
"542" height="438" />
<p>A CLASSROOM ALMOST AS GOOD AS THE OUT-OF-DOORS</p>
<p>Notice the windows open top and bottom, and the high windows
under the roof. Why are these good?</p>
</div>
<p>We must let the fresh air come in and the stale air go out. This
is one of the things that windows are for; and this is why they are
hung upon pulleys and made to slide up and down easily. Of course,
even when the windows are not open, they are letting in light,
which, you remember, is a deadly enemy to germs and poisons.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page50" name=
"page50"></a>50</span>Bright sunlight is best for purifying the air
of a room, but even ordinary daylight has a good deal of
germ-killing power. Therefore, a room that is well lighted is not
only much pleasanter to live in, but much healthier, than one that
is dull and gloomy. You see why we need plenty of windows and
doors: we must let in the breezes and the sunshine, and let out the
poisons and the dirt. Then, too, we must make the air in the
building move about in order to keep it fresh; for if the air is
not fresh, we soon grow tired and sleepy and have headaches. That
is why your teacher keeps the windows open at the top a foot or so.
You can easily see that when there are twenty or thirty of you
breathing out poisons, and each one of you needing about four
bushels of fresh air every minute, the old air ought to be going
out and the fresh air coming in all the time.</p>
<div class="figleft"><img src="images/figure18.png" alt=
"A candle at the bottom of an open window has the flame pointing in, while one at the top has a flame pointing out."
id="figure18" name="figure18" width="100%" />
<p>VENTILATION</p>
<p class="morecaption">Watch the candle flames. Which way is the
air moving, and why?</p>
</div>
<p>That is also why your teacher gives you a recess, so that you
can run out of doors and get some fresh air. Then she can throw
open all the windows and doors and have the air in the room
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page51" name=
"page51"></a>51</span>clean and fresh when you come back again. So
when recess comes, don&rsquo;t hang about in the hallways or on the
stairs or in the basement, but run right out of doors into the
playground and shout and throw your arms about and run races to
fill your lungs full of fresh, sweet air and stretch all your
muscles, after the confinement and sitting still. Don&rsquo;t
saunter about and whisper secrets or tell stories, but get up some
lively game that doesn&rsquo;t take long to play, such as tag or
steal-sticks or soak-ball, or duck-on-a-rock or skipping or
hopscotch. These will blow all the &ldquo;smoke&rdquo; out of your
lungs and send the hot blood flying all over your body and make you
as &ldquo;fresh as a daisy&rdquo; for your next lesson.</p>
<p>When you come back into the schoolroom after recess, the air
will seem quite fresh and pure; but unless you keep the windows
open, it will not be long before your head begins to be hot, and
your eyes heavy, and you feel like yawning and stretching, and
begin to wonder why the lessons are so long and tiresome. Then, if
your teacher will throw open all the windows and have you stand up,
or, better still, march around the room singing or go through some
drill or calisthenic exercises, you will soon feel quite fresh and
rested again.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page52" name=
"page52"></a>52</span>In the mild weather of the spring or early
fall, all you need to do to keep the air fresh in the schoolroom is
to keep the windows well open at the top. But in the winter, the
air outdoors is so cold that it has to be heated before it is
brought in; and this, in any modern and properly built schoolhouse,
is usually arranged for. The fresh air is drawn in through an
opening in the basement and is either heated, so that it rises, or
is blown by fans all over the building. This sort of fresh air,
however, is never quite so good as that which comes directly from
outdoors; so it is generally best to keep at least two or three
windows in each room opened at the top as well, and never to depend
entirely upon the air that comes through the heating system.</p>
<p>Sometimes this may mean a little draft, or current of
uncomfortably cool air, for one or two of you who sit nearest the
windows; but your teacher will always allow you to change your seat
if this proves very unpleasant. If you have plenty of warmth in the
room you sit in, unless the air outside is very cold, this
&ldquo;breeze&rdquo; won&rsquo;t do you any harm at all; on the
contrary, it will be good for you. Instead of catching cold from a
draft like this, it is from foul, stuffy, poisonous air, loaded
with other people&rsquo;s breaths and <span class="pagenum"><a id=
"page53" name="page53"></a>53</span>the germs contained in them,
that you catch cold.</p>
<div class="figcen"><img src="images/figure19.jpg" alt=

<p>GARDENS TAKE US OUT OF DOORS</p>
</div>
<p>In fact, staying indoors is usually the reason why people are
sick. They don&rsquo;t go out into the clean fresh air for fear
they&rsquo;ll be too cold! It seems a pity we can&rsquo;t just live
out of doors all the time. Perhaps we shall some day; for doctors
are finding out that fresh outdoor air and good food are the very
best medicines known, and the only &ldquo;Sure Cures.&rdquo; They
are pleasant to take, too. Many cities are providing outdoor
schools for children who have weak lungs or are not strong in other
ways. Perhaps some day all school children will be allowed to study
in the open air at least part of every school day.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page54" name=

<h3 id="Ch_4_2">II. HEARING AND LISTENING</h3>
<p>Now you are all ready to go to work. What are you going to work
with? Books? pencils? paper? Yes, but you have something better
than those and all ready for use. It is that little kit of tools
that are sometimes called our &ldquo;Five Senses.&rdquo; You
remember that we have already talked about one of them, the sense
of touch in the skin. Now which one are you going to use first this
morning? If your teacher talks to you, I hope it will be the one we
call the sense of hearing. Suppose we try to find out something
about this sense of hearing, and begin with a little
experiment.</p>
<p>Take a piece of cork in your hand and lift it up high and then
let it drop into a large basin or tub of water. What happens? The
cork strikes and then goes bob-bob-bobbing up and down on its own
waves. Now watch the little waves all around the cork. Where do
they stop? They don&rsquo;t stop until they touch the edge of the
pan; and no matter how big the pan is, the waves go on and on until
they reach the edge.</p>
<p>We can see these waves of water, and so we easily believe that
they are there. Now there are, just as truly, waves of air all
around us. We cannot see the waves, because they are too small
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page55" name="page55"></a>55</span>and
roll too quickly. But some of these, when they roll against our
ears, make us hear. They make what we call <em>sound</em>. You have
heard about sending messages through the air, without telegraph
wires. Wireless messages are often sent to ships out in the middle
of the ocean. This is done by starting tiny electric waves, which
travel through the air much as the waves of water are traveling
across the ocean beneath. Of course there must be a machine, called
a <em>receiver</em>, to catch the waves and &ldquo;hear&rdquo; the
message.</p>
<p>Mother Nature has given each of you two very delicate little
receivers to catch the sound waves and carry them to your brain.
You know what they are&mdash;you can name them. But how are these
wonderful little machines made?</p>
<p>You have never seen the whole of your ear. The part on the
outside of the head, of course, you can easily see and feel.
Sometimes you notice a deaf person put his hand behind his ear and
press it forward so as to catch the sound waves better. These waves
roll in at the little hole you can see, and travel along a short
passage till they come to a round <em>drum</em>, a piece of very
thin skin stretched tight like a drumhead.</p>
<p>Have you ever beaten a drum with a stick? You felt the drumhead
quiver under the blow, <span class="pagenum"><a id="page56" name=
"page56"></a>56</span>did you not? Well, when the sound waves beat
against the drum in the ear, it quivers and starts little waves
inside the ear. Each little wave in turn beats against a little
bone called the <em>hammer</em>; the hammer beats against another
called the <em>anvil</em>, and this against a third called the
<em>stirrup</em>; and the quiver of the stirrup is passed on to a
little window, opening into a little room with a spiral key-board;
and from this, the wave travels along a nerve to the brain. As the
waves reach the brain, the brain hears. In this way we hear all
sorts of sounds, from the tick of a watch to the whistle of a
train.</p>
<div class="figleft"><img src="images/figure20.png" alt=
"A diagram of the structure of the ear." id="figure20" name=
"figure20" width="100%" />
<p>THE WAY BY WHICH SOUND WAVES REACH THE BRAIN</p>
<p class="morecaption">A section through the right ear.</p>
</div>
<p>There is a sensible old saying, &ldquo;Never put anything
smaller than your elbow into the inner part of your ear.&rdquo;
Now, of course, you can&rsquo;t put your elbow into such a tiny
hole! So the old saying means, never put anything in. The eardrum
is very thin and can easily be broken. Even a slap on the ear, or a
loud sound too close to it, <span class="pagenum"><a id="page57"
name="page57"></a>57</span>might crack and spoil the drum and make
one deaf.</p>
<p>The outside ear needs careful washing; there are so many little
creases that gather dirt and dust. The deep crease behind the ear,
too, will become sore if it is not kept clean.</p>
<p>Besides cleaning your ears, you must train them to listen. Some
boys and girls hear just a word or two of what is said, and then
guess at the rest and think they are listening, or else ask to have
it repeated. We should try to hear exactly what is said; and if we
listen carefully, it will soon be much easier to understand at
once.</p>
<p>Of course, if you really cannot hear, the doctor can tell you
what is the matter, and usually can help you very much. Sometimes
people become deaf simply because the throat is swollen. Indeed,
most deafness comes from colds and catarrhs and other inflammations
of the nose and throat. These spread to the ear through a little
tube that runs up to the drum cavity from the back of the throat.
Sometimes, when you are blowing your nose, you may feel your ear go
&ldquo;pop&rdquo;; and that means that you have blown air up into
the ear through this little tube. Be sure to see a doctor if you
don&rsquo;t hear well; and be sure, too, to tell your teacher, so
that she <span class="pagenum"><a id="page58" name=
"page58"></a>58</span>may know why it is you do not hear what she
says, and ask her to give you a seat near her, so that you can
hear.</p>
<p>Then, too, you should learn to notice outdoor sounds&mdash;the
songs of the birds, the noises that the animals make, the wind in
the trees, and the patter of the rain. The old Norsemen have a
story that their god Heimdall had such keen ears that he could hear
the grass growing in the meadow and the wool growing on the backs
of the sheep! Your ears can never be so keen as that; but there are
many, many happy outdoor sounds that you should listen for. They
will help to make you happy, too.</p>
<p>Careful listening may sometime save your life. You can hear the
car or the train coming, and you can learn to tell from which
direction a sound comes. You can learn to tell one sound from
another in the midst of many sounds. In more ways than you can
think of now, this habit of listening will protect you from
danger.</p>
<p>The Germans have a proverb, &ldquo;Hear much and say
little.&rdquo; What does it mean?</p>

<h3 id="Ch_4_3">III. SEEING AND READING</h3>
<p>You can learn a great deal through your ears, but think how much
more you can learn through <span class="pagenum"><a id="page60"
name="page60"></a>60</span>your eyes. Just count over all the
things that you have had to get your eyes to tell you to-day, and
then shut your eyes for a minute and think what it would mean never
to be able to see. Don&rsquo;t you think you ought to take very
good care of your eyes? You are going to keep them very busy all
your life, and they deserve the very best care you can give
them.</p>

<p>THE LIGHT ON THE PAGE, NOT IN THE EYES</p>
</div>
<p>Just as soon as lessons begin, you get out your books; and a
good share of the day in school you have a book before you, reading
it or studying it or copying from it. It makes a great difference
to your eyes how you hold the book and how the light falls. In
reading, you should always hold your book so that the light falls
upon the page from behind you, or from over one of your shoulders.
In this way, the brightest light that comes into your eyes is not
from the window, but from the page of your book.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page61" name=
"page61"></a>61</span>If the light comes from a window in front of
you, or if you sit in the evening with your face toward the lamp
when you read, the light coming straight from the lamp or the
window, as well as the light coming up from the pages of the book,
pours into your eyes; and this dazzles and confuses your eyes, so
that you can&rsquo;t see plainly and comfortably and are very
likely after a while to find that your head aches. At home, of
course, you can seat yourself with your back to the light when you
read; and usually at school your seats are so arranged that the
light falls from behind you or from one side. If not, by turning a
little in your seat, you can get the light from over your
shoulder.</p>
<p>Notice how the light falls upon the blackboard. When the light
comes from the windows behind you, or from one side, you can see
what is written there quite plainly. But if the blackboard happens
to be between two windows, and especially if this is the lightest
side of the room, you will find that the light dazzles you so that
you cannot see the writing clearly.</p>
<p>You must have noticed, too, that if, after you have been reading
from the blackboard you look down again suddenly to the page of
your book, for an instant you will not see the letters plainly.
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page62" name=
"page62"></a>62</span>Then, almost before you have time to notice
it, you feel a little change take place inside your eyes, and the
print upon the page of your book becomes quite plain. This is
because your eye has to change the shape of one of the parts inside
it, called the <em>lens</em>, before you can see clearly the things
that are near you. This change, which is called
<em>accommodation</em>, is made by a little muscle of the eye; and
if you keep your eyes working at close work, like reading or
writing or fancy-work, too long at a time, or if your eyes need
glasses to make them see clearly, and you haven&rsquo;t them on,
this little muscle becomes tired. Then the print of your book, or
your writing, or the stitches you have taken begin to blur before
your eyes. Your eyes begin to feel tired, and your head begins to
ache. This is what we call <em>eye strain</em>.</p>
<p>Sometimes this eye strain upsets your appetite or your digestion
and makes you sleepless and worried. The trouble may be caused by
your own carelessness: you may have been reading too long, or in a
poor light, or with the light shining right in your face instead of
coming over your shoulder. But sometimes it is caused by the fact
that your eyes are not just the right shape; and then the only way
to relieve it is to have proper <span class="pagenum"><a id=
"page63" name="page63"></a>63</span>glasses, or spectacles, fitted,
which will make up for this too flat or too round shape, or too
large or too small size, of your eyes.</p>
<p>If you cannot see clearly what is written on the blackboard when
the light falls upon it from behind you, or above; or if, in a good
light, you cannot read the words in your book quite easily, without
straining at all, when you hold the book either at arm&rsquo;s
length or a foot from your face; or if your head aches or your eyes
begin to feel tired or uncomfortable, or the letters begin to blur,
after you have read steadily&mdash;say, for half an hour,&mdash;it
is a pretty sure sign that there is some trouble with your eyes.
Then you had better have them examined at once by your family
doctor or by the school doctor. In many schools now there are
doctors to test the children&rsquo;s eyes, and ears, too, so that
each child may have a chance to see and hear everything that the
other children can see and hear.</p>
<p>Not very many years ago people thought that glasses were only
for old people, but now we know that many children&rsquo;s eyes
need glasses, too. I knew a little girl whose sight was so poor
that when she was standing and looked down at the grass, she
couldn&rsquo;t see the green blades. She thought that the grass
looked like a green blur <span class="pagenum"><a id="page64" name=
"page64"></a>64</span>to everyone, just as it did to her; and so
she never said anything about it. She was twelve or thirteen years
old before she found out that she couldn&rsquo;t see clearly. Of
course, trying hard to see things gave her a headache and made her
tired and cross. So some one took her to a doctor, and he saw at
once what was the matter and fitted her with glasses. Soon she was
quite well and strong; and how glad she was to see the leaves and a
hundred other things she had not seen before!</p>
<div class="figleft"><img src="images/figure23.png" alt=

<p>THE EYEBALL IN ITS SOCKET</p>
<p class="morecaption">The muscle from M to M, which helps to turn
the eyeball, has been cut away to show the optic nerve.</p>
</div>
<p>Here we have a picture of the <em>eyeball</em>, as we call it.
The little bands fastened to it are the bands of muscle; and as
soon as I say <em>muscle</em> you know what they are for&mdash;to
move the eyeball about, up and down and from side to side. There
are muscles outside the eye as well as inside. Coming out from the
back of the eyeball is a pearly white cord quite different from the
muscle bands. This is what we call a <em>nerve</em>. This nerve in
your eye carries to your <em>brain</em>, or <span class=
"pagenum"><a id="page65" name="page65"></a>65</span>thinking
machine, picture-messages of whatever you look at.</p>
<p>The nerve in your eye gets messages of light much as the nerve
deep in your ear gets its messages of sound&mdash;from tiny waves
in the air. The light waves are smaller and faster even than the
sound waves, and the eye nerve is the only nerve that can get
pictures of them. You know that, for wireless messages, the
receiving machines are not all alike and cannot all take the same
messages, if the messages are sent with different sorts of electric
waves; and neither can our receiving machines. Some get messages of
sight, and some of sound, and some of touch, or taste, or
smell.</p>
<p>Now shut your eyes as quickly as you can. How long did it take
you? A minute? No, not a quarter of a second. It is about the
quickest thing you can think of&mdash;&ldquo;the twinkling of an
eye.&rdquo; You shut your eyes &ldquo;quick as a wink&rdquo;
whenever anything seems likely to fly or splash into them, and this
is what the eyelids are for. If anything gets into the eye before
the lids can shut, the eye &ldquo;waters,&rdquo; and <em>tears</em>
pour out of it. These are made by a gland-sponge up under the upper
lid, so as to wash any dust or sand or other harmful speck out of
the eye before it can hurt the sensitive eyeball.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page66" name=
"page66"></a>66</span>Now look at some one&rsquo;s eyeball. It is
like the picture, isn&rsquo;t it?&mdash;bright white around the
edge and then a ring of color, brown or blue or gray; and inside
the color-ring, or <em>iris</em>, a little round black hole that we
call the <em>pupil</em>. Watch the little hole change as you turn
the face toward the window. It becomes ever so much smaller. Now
turn the face away from the window, back again into the shadow. How
did the pupil change this time?</p>
<div class="figcen"><img src="images/figure24.png" alt=
"A cat in shadow and a cat in light." id="figure24" name="figure24"
width="434" height="169" />
<p>EYES PROTECT THEMSELVES AGAINST THE LIGHT</p>
</div>
<p>The iris, or color-ring, acts like a curtain, like the
ring-shutter of a camera, and closes up the hole, or pupil, when
the light is too bright and would dazzle or burn the inside of the
eye; but when the light is dim, the iris opens again, so as to let
in light enough with which to see. Look at the little window in
your kitten&rsquo;s eyes. It is not the same shape as yours; but
when you carry her to the light, you see how the iris closes in and
leaves just a little black slit or line.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page67" name=
"page67"></a>67</span>You remember the blind children? Isn&rsquo;t
it wonderful how they can play games and study, too, even though
they are blind! They have to make their senses of touch and hearing
tell them many things that you learn through your sense of sight.
Many of these children <em>need not have been blind</em>, if the
nurse who first took care of them when they were born had known
enough to wash their eyes properly, not with soap and water, of
course, but with just one or two drops of a kind of
medicine&mdash;an <em>antiseptic</em>, as we call it&mdash;that
makes the eye perfectly clean.</p>
<p>But you children who have good eyes that can see, do you really
see things when you look at them? You can train your eyes just as
you can train your ears. You can teach them to read quickly down a
page, and to find things in pictures, and, better still, to see
things out of doors, in the garden and the woods and on the
seashore. We hear a great deal about &ldquo;sharp eyes,&rdquo; but
most of us see very little of all we might see. Our eyes are on the
lookout, too, to protect us from dangers that may come; with our
skin and nose and ears, they are constantly on the watch; so the
better we see the safer we are.</p>
<p>Even if your eyes are perfect now, you will need to take good
care of them to keep them <span class="pagenum"><a id="page68"
name="page68"></a>68</span>strong. Don&rsquo;t let any story, no
matter how interesting it is, tempt you to read in a dim light or a
light that is too strong. And if you can&rsquo;t see the blackboard
easily, or can&rsquo;t read big print, like the school calendar,
across the room, tell your mother or your teacher, so that she can
ask the doctor to find out what the matter is.</p>
<h3 id="Ch_4_4">IV. A DRINK OF WATER</h3>
<p>It is astonishing what thirsty work studying is! Scarcely is the
second recitation over before your throat begins to feel dry, and
up goes your hand&mdash;&ldquo;May I get a drink?&rdquo;</p>
<p>If anyone even says the word &ldquo;water,&rdquo; it makes you
thirsty. It is so good that just the thought of it makes you want
some. I should like you to notice how much water you drink every
day. Perhaps a glass in the morning when you get up, and one at
night before you go to bed, and three or four in between.</p>
<p>Why do we need so much water? Well, how much do you weigh?
Perhaps you will find it hard to believe, but more than half of
that weight is water; and because we are always giving off water
from the skin and from the body, we need plenty more to take its
place.</p>
<p>No living thing can grow without water. Take <span class=
"pagenum"><a id="page69" name="page69"></a>69</span>a bean, for
instance, and put it in an empty glass on the window sill; and even
if the sun shines full upon it, nothing will happen, except that
after a few days it will shrivel and dry up. But fill the glass
with water, and in a few hours the bean will begin to swell; and in
a few days it will burst, and a little shoot will grow out of one
end of it and a tiny root at the other. The water and the warmth
together have made it sprout and grow.</p>
<div class="figcen"><img src="images/figure25.png" alt=
"A sheet of paper folded into a cone." id="figure25" name=
"figure25" width="100%" />
<p>A DRINKING-CUP EASILY MADE</p>
</div>
<p>Children at school and people on trains should have their own
private cups, for serious diseases may be caught from the mouths of
other people. You can get a metal pocket folding cup for ten or
fifteen cents, or paper ones for a few cents a <span class=
"pagenum"><a id="page70" name="page70"></a>70</span>dozen. If you
don&rsquo;t have your own cup, I hope you will get one and carry
it. Here is a pattern for a paper cup that you can easily make for
yourselves. Try it and see. When you have once learned how, you can
make it very quickly and have a fresh cup every time you want one;
but of course you should be sure first that the paper itself is
clean.</p>
<p>If you drink milk, this takes the place of some of the water and
gives you food as well. It is both drink and food; and a very good
food for children it is, too. You know, babies can live on it
because it has everything in it to make them grow.</p>
<p>Do you know why it is that people are so careful nowadays about
having milk and drinking-water very clean? It is because they have
found that the tiny plants, called germs, that make people sick are
often carried about in these drinks. A disease called <em>typhoid
fever</em> is carried in this way.</p>
<p>Fifty years ago, cities and towns used to be very careless about
where they got their water supply, and would often take it out of
streams into which other cities emptied their sewage. Now, however,
they are much more particular; and the health officers, or Boards
of Health, are insisting that public water supply, such as is
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page71" name=
"page71"></a>71</span>brought into our houses in pipes, shall be
taken either from some spring or deep-flowing well, or from a
stream or lake up in the hills, into which no drainage from houses
or farmyards, and no dirty water from factories, empties.</p>
<div class="figcen"><img src="images/figure26.jpg" alt=
"A pipe in a trench." id="figure26" name="figure26" width="544"
height="366" />
<p>A PIPE FOR THE CITY WATER SUPPLY</p>
<p>This pipe is laid for many miles to bring water from the distant
hills.</p>
</div>
<p>We are still, however, far from being as careful as we should be
about this; and I am sorry to say that America has had more deaths
from typhoid fever than any other civilized country. Germany,
which, of all countries in the world, is the most particular about
keeping its water supply pure, has the fewest deaths from this
cause, in proportion to its population&mdash;scarcely one fifth as
many as we have.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page72" name=
"page72"></a>72</span>Therefore, by taking proper care, it would be
quite possible to prevent at least two thirds of our nearly 400,000
cases of typhoid fever and 35,000 deaths from typhoid, every
year.</p>
<p>It is not only cities and towns that ought to be careful of
their water supply. In fact, now, out on the farms and in the
healthy country districts, the death rate from typhoid fever has
actually become higher than it is in our large cities. The main
cause of this is the custom of digging the well in such a place
that the waste water thrown out from the house, or the drainage
from the barnyard or the pigpen or the chicken-house may wash into
it, soaking down through the porous soil. Far more typhoid fever
now is spread by means of infected well water than by any other
means.</p>
<p>Most dangerous of all is the leakage from the privy vault; as,
by this means, the germs of typhoid fever and other diseases that
affect the food tube and digestion may drain through the soil till
they reach the drinking water in the well. These dangers can be
avoided either by having the well dug at some distance from the
house and in higher ground, or by having the drainage from the
house, barns, and out-buildings piped and carried to a safe
distance from the well.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page73" name=
"page73"></a>73</span>Fortunately, there are only a few kinds of
germs that make us sick. Most germs are helping us all the time; we
could not live without them. Some of them make our butter taste
good, and others make our crops grow, and others eat up the dirt
that would make us sick. But since disease germs are so tiny that
we cannot possibly see them with the naked eye, we must know where
the water and milk that we use come from, and whether or not they
are perfectly clean. Boiling the water will kill these germs and
make the water pure. It is better not to boil milk if it can be had
from a dairy where the stable and the cows and the milkmen and the
pails and bottles are quite clean.</p>
<p>The fruits and fruit juices&mdash;lemon and orange and raspberry
and lime and grape&mdash;give nice wholesome drinks. Home-made
juices are much better than those you buy; you can be sure that
they are pure and really made from fruit. And just here I want to
caution you against buying &ldquo;pink lemonade&rdquo; or soda
water or any other drink of that sort from the penny venders and
open stalls on the street. The drinks they sell are not made from
pure fruit juices, but from different flavoring extracts that are
made to taste like the fruit and are colored with cheap
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page74" name=
"page74"></a>74</span>dyes. Even the sweetening in them is not pure
sugar, and they are often made or handled in a careless, dirty
manner, or exposed to the dust of the street, and to flies.</p>
<p>Not long ago I was at the home of a friend where for supper we
had the nicest grape juice I ever tasted. When I said, &ldquo;How
good it is!&rdquo; one of the little girls piped up, &ldquo;Billy
and I picked the grapes, and sister made it all by herself. She
learned how at cooking school.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When I was packing my suitcase to leave, this little girl
brought out a big bottle of grape juice and wanted me to take it
with me to remember her by. It was all beautifully sealed with wax,
and even this she had done by herself! Do you think I could have
kept it that way very long? Perhaps not, it was so good; but if I
had wanted it for a keepsake, I could have kept it, sealed as it
was, for years and years, and it would have been just as sweet and
fresh as when it was given to me.</p>
<p>Suppose, instead of keeping it in its bottle, I had poured it
out into a glass. Can you tell me what would have happened to it
then?</p>
<p>In a few days little bubbles would have come, one after another,
up to the top of the juice; and soon it would have been all full of
bubbles. What <span class="pagenum"><a id="page75" name=
"page75"></a>75</span>causes the bubbles? Floating all about in the
air and sunshine are tiny specks called <em>spores</em>. These are
to the tiny <em>yeast</em> plants what seeds are to other plants.
Seeds fall into the ground and grow, but these yeast spores fall
into the grape juice and grow. While they are growing in the grape
juice, they eat what they want from the juice; and, as they eat,
they make bubbles of carbon dioxid,&mdash;which, you remember,
forms in our lungs and looks like air,&mdash;and of another
substance called <em>alcohol</em>. Of course, when they have
changed the juice in this way, it tastes very different. It is then
what we call <em>fermented</em>.</p>
<p><em>Fermented drinks are harmful</em>; but some people like
bubbling drinks so much that they leave good fresh grape juice open
on purpose to let the little yeast plants get into it and make it
into what we call <em>wine</em>. They treat apple juice in just the
same way to make <em>cider</em>; and they even take fresh rye and
barley and corn, and mash them up, and put yeast plants into the
mash to ferment them and make them into <em>whiskey</em> and
<em>beer</em>. It does seem a pity, doesn&rsquo;t it, to take good
foods like wheat and apples and grapes and make them into these
things that really do us harm if we drink them.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page76" name=
"page76"></a>76</span>A very wise man named Solomon, who lived
thousands of years ago, warned people not to drink wine, not even
to look at it when it sparkled in the cup. He said no really wise
man would drink it. Of course not; the wise man uses the food and
drink that make his body grow strong and his brain work true, and
no fermented drink can do that.</p>
<p>There is no better drink for anyone than clear pure water, and
no better food and drink in one than pure fresh milk.</p>

<p>A SCHOOL KITCHEN WHERE BOTH BOYS AND GIRLS LEARN TO COOK</p>
</div>
<h3 id="Ch_4_5">V. LITTLE COOKS</h3>
<p>If you have to come so far to school that you cannot go back to
dinner and so must bring a luncheon with you, be sure to take
plenty of time to sit down and eat it slowly and chew every piece
of food thoroughly. Many children who bring luncheons to school
just grab a piece of food in each hand and &ldquo;bolt&rdquo; it
down as fast as they can possibly bite it off and swallow it, and
then rush out to play.</p>
<p>Play is good and very important, but you had better spare ten or
fifteen minutes of it in order to chew your lunch thoroughly and
swallow it slowly, and then to sit or move about quietly for a few
minutes before starting to play hard. <span class="pagenum"><a id=
"page78" name="page78"></a>78</span>This will give your stomach a
chance to get all the blood it wants to use in digesting the food;
for, you remember, when you romp and play, your blood moves outward
toward your skin and away from your stomach. Don&rsquo;t think
that, just because you &ldquo;picnic&rdquo; at lunch, it is not as
important as any other meal.</p>
<p>I hope, however, that it will not be long before almost every
school will have a school kitchen and a lunch room; first, so that
every girl at least can learn to cook. It is well worth while being
able to do; indeed, no girl ought to be considered properly
educated until she has learned to cook, and no boy either, for that
matter. Then, if the school has this kitchen, it can be used to
furnish hot luncheons, or dinners, for those children who cannot
conveniently go home in the noon recess. Hot lunches are much more
digestible than cold ones, and they taste much better, and are much
less likely to be eaten in a hurry.</p>
<p>But why should we learn to cook? Why shouldn&rsquo;t we eat our
food raw instead of taking all this trouble and pains to cook
it?</p>
<p>I know of a boy&mdash;a big lazy fellow&mdash;who is always
forgetting to do things. He used to go away in the morning without
leaving wood enough for the kitchen fire. So his mother said
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page79" name="page79"></a>79</span>to
herself one day, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll teach him to remember.&rdquo;
The next morning he went off again and left no wood. At noon he
came back &ldquo;hungry as a hunter.&rdquo; She called him in to
dinner; and in he came, sat down, picked up the carving
knife&mdash;then he stopped! What do you suppose was the matter?
The beef was raw! Then he lifted the cover of the potato dish, and
there lay the potatoes raw! Then he tried another dish and found
nice green peas, but hard as little bullets. They were raw, too!
Not even the bread had been cooked; it was a soft, sticky mass of
dough. His mother, who is a jolly old lady, fairly shook with
laughter when she told me about it. She said she never again had to
tell him to split wood.</p>
<p>Now that boy didn&rsquo;t need to be told one reason for
cooking. We don&rsquo;t like our food raw; it doesn&rsquo;t taste
so good. At first, perhaps, that doesn&rsquo;t sound like a very
good reason; but it is more important than you think. For it is a
fact that, just as soon as you smell food, your stomach begins to
get ready the juice that is to digest it. If this very first juice,
which is called the <em>appetite juice</em>, is not poured out,
then the food may lie in the stomach some little time before it
begins to be digested at all. So it is quite important that our
food should smell and taste <span class="pagenum"><a id="page80"
name="page80"></a>80</span>and look good, as well as have plenty of
strength and nourishment in it.</p>
<p>Another reason for cooking is that it either softens or crisps
our food so that we can chew it better and digest it more readily.
You know what a difference there is between trying to eat a raw
potato and a nice, mealy, well-baked one, or trying to eat popcorn
before it is popped and after.</p>
<p>Another good thing, too, cooking does, which is very important.
It kills any disease germs, or germs of decay, that may happen to
have got upon the food from dust or flies, or from careless, dirty
handling.</p>
<p>Of course, some of our food, such as apples and other ripe
fruits, and celery and lettuce and other green vegetables, we can
eat raw and digest quite well; but we should be careful to see that
they have been thoroughly washed with water that we know to be
pure. Grocers often have a careless way of putting fruit and
vegetables out upon open stands in front of the shop, or in open
boxes or baskets inside the store, and leaving them there all day.
This is very dangerous, because dust from the street, which
contains horse manure and all sorts of germs, may blow in upon
them; flies, which have been eating garbage <span class=
"pagenum"><a id="page81" name="page81"></a>81</span>or feeding at
the mouths of sewers, may come in and crawl over them. You ought to
be very sure that anything that you are going to eat raw, or
without thorough cooking, has been well washed. And you ought to
ask your mother to speak to your grocer, if he is careless in this
way, and have him keep his fruit and vegetables, as well as sugar
and crackers and beans and dried fruit, either under glass or well
screened from flies and dust.</p>
<p>More important than almost anything else in good cookery is to
keep the food and the kitchen and the dishes and your hands
perfectly clean all the way through, so that nothing that will
upset your digestion can get into the food. After things are well
cooked, it is very important that they should be nicely served on
clean dishes, on a clean table cloth, with polished knives and
shining spoons and forks. This means not only that everything about
the table and the food will be perfectly clean and wholesome, but
that you will enjoy eating it a great deal more. And when you enjoy
your food, you remember, your stomach can <em>secrete</em> the
juice that is needed to digest it, very much faster and better than
when, as you say, you are just &ldquo;poking it down.&rdquo;</p>
<p>If you have a school kitchen and a lunch <span class=
"pagenum"><a id="page82" name="page82"></a>82</span>room, you can
learn the best way of cooking and serving things; and then,
perhaps, you can do these same things at home and be a real help.
Most children are fond of trying to cook, and I am glad that they
are. Everyone, boys and girls both, should know how to cook simple
things. Perhaps some day you will be stranded, like Robinson
Crusoe, on a desert island! Perhaps the rest of the family may be
sick. How nice it would be for you to be able to prepare breakfast
for them. I know a family where the youngest boy often rises early
and gets breakfast for five. He can fry the bacon and boil the eggs
and make the coffee and mush and biscuit just as nicely as his
mother can; and he takes pride in it and enjoys it.</p>
<p>Cooking is what we call an art. Everyone, of course, can learn
to do it; but some people can do it much better than others, just
as some boys and girls can draw better than others. I hope some of
you will be what we might call &ldquo;artist cooks.&rdquo; Take
pride in the art and learn all that you can about it. There are so
many things a cook should know.</p>
<p>A great deal of good food is spoiled by bad cookery,
particularly by frying slowly in tepid grease, or fat, so that it
becomes soaked with <span class="pagenum"><a id="page83" name=
"page83"></a>83</span>grease. You should have the frying pan just
as hot as possible before you begin to fry; and then the meat or
potatoes or cakes will be seared, or coated over, on the outside,
so that the fat cannot soak into them, and they will not only taste
better, but will be much more digestible.</p>
<p>In baking you will have to be careful not to let the oven become
too hot, or else the meat or bread will be burned or scorched. Even
if the heat does not do this, it may harden and toughen the outside
of the meat so that it is almost impossible either to chew or
digest.</p>
<p>Sugar is really a very good food if you do not eat too much at
once, and so pure candy is good for you if you do not eat too much.
The very best time to eat it is at the end of a meal. If you learn
to make it at school or at home, you can always have some to eat
after your luncheon without having to buy it. If you do buy candy,
don&rsquo;t get the bright colored kind; it looks pretty, but it
may hurt you. And be sure to see that it has been kept under a
cover, where the dust and flies could not get at it. Dust is dirty,
and flies don&rsquo;t wipe their feet. You want clean, pure
candy.</p>
<p>Of course, after cooking, you will always be very careful to
wash up all the pots and pans and dishes that you have used. Food
and scraps <span class="pagenum"><a id="page84" name=
"page84"></a>84</span>that are left sticking to dishes and cooking
utensils very quickly turn sour and decay; and then the next time
the dishes are used, you will perhaps have an attack of
indigestion, and wonder why.</p>
<p>There are two things you should always notice: Whether the bread
you eat is sweet and thoroughly baked; if it is soggy and sour, it
will make trouble in your stomach. Whether all your food is clean
and fresh before it is cooked; this you can tell by your eyes and
nose.</p>
<h3 id="Ch_4_6">VI. TASTING AND SMELLING</h3>
<p>When, at home, you give the baby a ball or a key or a watch to
play with, what does he do with it the very first thing? He is
never quite happy, is he, until he has put it into his mouth? Does
he want to eat it? No, he wants to feel it; and he has not yet
learned to feel very carefully with his hands, as you do.</p>
<p>Can you feel with your mouth? If you have the least little hole
in one of your teeth, you know it as soon as you rub your tongue
against it. How big it feels and how rough the edges seem! If you
take a looking-glass, you find, if you can see the hole at all,
that it is just a tiny, tiny hole.</p>
<p>Your tongue and lips, like the rest of your skin, <span class=
"pagenum"><a id="page85" name="page85"></a>85</span>are always
touching and feeling things for you and sending messages to the
brain. They say whether your milk is hot or cold, and whether the
food you eat is soft enough and quite right in other ways. Your
tongue is a very busy little &ldquo;waiter&rdquo;: he passes the
food about in your mouth for the teeth to chew, and he rolls it
about at a great rate. But he does more than this; he tells you
something about how it tastes&mdash;not everything, as you may
think, but only whether it is <em>bitter</em>, <em>sweet</em>,
<em>sour</em>, or <em>salty</em>. Queer as it may seem, your nose
tells you the other &ldquo;tastes,&rdquo; which are really smells.
It is your nose that says whether you have a strawberry or a piece
of onion in your mouth, whether it is coffee or cocoa that you are
drinking.</p>
<p>Of what other use is your nose?&mdash;for only a little patch in
the upper part is for smelling and tasting. The greater part of the
nose is to breathe through. You see, your nose warms and moistens
the outside air that you take in, so that, by the time it reaches
your throat, it is as warm as your body and does not hurt your
throat. Your nose also strains, or filters, out of the air the
dust, lint, and germs that may be floating in it.</p>
<p>You should always keep your lips closed and breathe through your
nose. Whenever you cannot <span class="pagenum"><a id="page86"
name="page86"></a>86</span>breathe through your nose, there is
something the matter. It may be that your nose is swollen shut with
a &ldquo;cold&rdquo;; but that will last only a few days. If,
however, your nose often feels &ldquo;stuffed up,&rdquo; there is
probably something in it or behind it, that ought to be taken away.
A throat doctor can easily cure you; and, when he has, you&rsquo;ll
be surprised how much better you feel and how much faster you
grow.</p>
<div class="figleft"><img src="images/figure28.jpg" alt=
"A side-view diagram of the mouth, nose and throat." id="figure28"
name="figure28" width="100%" />
<p>A CLEAR PASSAGE TO THE LUNGS</p>
<p>(Follow the arrows.)</p>
</div>
<p>I once knew a little girl whose nose was always blocked up. She
had headache and felt tired most of the time and was behind in her
classes. The doctor told her what was the matter, but her father
and mother were afraid that it might hurt her to have the doctor
take out what was clogging her nose. Well, what did she do? Instead
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page87" name="page87"></a>87</span>of
crying and being afraid, one day she walked right into the
doctor&rsquo;s office and asked him to take out the
<em>adenoids</em>, as we call these growths that block up the nose.
And after the doctor had taken them out, she began to grow well and
fat and strong so fast that she soon &ldquo;caught up&rdquo; in her
classes.</p>
<div class="figright"><img src="images/figure29.jpg" alt=
"A diagram of the nose and the back of the throat." id="figure29"
name="figure29" width="100%" />
<p>A PASSAGE BLOCKED BY ADENOIDS</p>
</div>
<p>When you breathe well through your nose, you can smell and taste
better, too. In fact, when your nose is clogged, you cannot smell
at all.</p>
<p>How does this sense of smell help us? You say we can smell the
flowers and the fresh air after the rain, and cookies baking, and
all the things that we like so well. Yes, and these give us
pleasure; but how about the bad smells? The bad smells are
warnings. If there is a dead mouse or rat about, we smell it; and
that leads us to look for it and take it away. We smell the dirt
and get rid of it, and thus keep away sickness. When we walk into a
room, if the air is bad we <span class="pagenum"><a id="page88"
name="page88"></a>88</span>smell it at once and open a window or a
door, and so save ourselves from being poisoned.</p>
<p>Some people hurt their noses by smoking tobacco. The inside skin
of the nose is very delicate, and the smoke going back and forth
through the nose and the throat keeps them from doing their work
properly. It is very bad for little children even to smell tobacco
smoke. It seems in some way to keep them from growing as they would
in clear fresh air. What a silly habit smoking is! It does no one
any good. It hurts not only the people who make the smoke, but the
people who have to smell it. Most of the people who smoke tobacco
have to learn to like it. It almost always makes them very sick
when they first begin.</p>
<p>Sir Walter Raleigh, or the men he sent to America, first taught
our great-great-great-grandfathers to smoke. His men bought tobacco
of the Indians here and took it back to England; and Sir Walter
himself learned to smoke and made smoking fashionable. The first
time that Sir Walter&rsquo;s servant saw him smoking, he thought
his master was on fire; so what did he do but bring a big bucket of
water and throw it all over him! I wish that that bucket of water
had settled the matter, so that Sir Walter had stopped <span class=
"pagenum"><a id="page89" name="page89"></a>89</span>smoking and had
never taught anyone else to smoke. If it had, think how much money
might have been put to better use, for smoking is a very costly
habit. And it is not only wasteful of money, but, worse still, of
health; for it is the cause of a great deal of poor health and
disease.</p>
<p>Remember that you want the air you breathe perfectly fresh and
clean and not spoiled and poisoned by tobacco smoke.</p>
<h3 id="Ch_4_7">VII. TALKING AND RECITING</h3>
<p>When I was little and playing with my brothers, I did not always
do what they wanted. So they&rsquo;d sometimes say,
&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll put him in Coventry, then he&rsquo;ll do
it.&rdquo; They did not really <em>put</em> me anywhere. They
simply would not speak to me or answer anything I said. It was just
as if I were entirely alone. Of course it was a quick way to make
me ready to take my part in the game again.</p>
<p>How do you think you would feel if you never, never could speak
to anyone, and no one could speak to you? What a quiet world
we&rsquo;d have! Almost every day I meet a boy who can&rsquo;t hear
and can&rsquo;t speak. How does he ask for things? He makes letters
and spells words with his fingers, and his friends watch his
fingers and read what <span class="pagenum"><a id="page90" name=
"page90"></a>90</span>he says. Is that the way you do? &ldquo;No,
indeed,&rdquo; you say, &ldquo;I talk.&rdquo; &ldquo;What do you
talk with?&rdquo; &ldquo;I talk with my mouth.&rdquo; Yes,
that&rsquo;s true enough; but if you did not use something besides
your mouth, you&rsquo;d never make a sound.</p>
<p>Where does the sound come from? Feel gently with your finger and
thumb along the front of your neck. Do you find something harder
than the rest of your throat? That is the large tube called your
<em>windpipe</em>. Do you feel a ridge sticking out from this? Now
sing or talk a little. You can feel the ridge move up and down, and
the sound thrill in it. That is where the sound comes from. That is
your voice-and-music box, or <em>larynx</em>.</p>
<p>You have seen the little red rubber balloons, haven&rsquo;t you?
You blow into them until they are big and round; and then, when you
take your mouth away, out comes the air, making a squawking or
whistling sound. Now, if you look closely at the mouthpiece, you
see a tiny piece of rubber tied across it. The air rushing past
this rubber is what makes your balloon sing.</p>
<p>Your own music box is made on the same plan. When you breathe
out, the air is pushed from your lungs up the pipe that we call the
windpipe. In the upper part of this is the little box, a
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page91" name=
"page91"></a>91</span>corner of which you can feel with your thumb
and finger. Across the box, inside, are stretched two folds of skin
and muscle, just as the rubber is stretched across the opening of
the balloon. Whenever you like, you can blow out your breath
between these folds of skin in your voice box. Blow it out in one
way, and what happens? You are singing. Blow it out in another way,
and you are talking; in still another way, and you are just making
a noise&mdash;perhaps mewing like a kitten, or neighing like a
horse. If you pull these folds of skin close together, you can
close your windpipe and &ldquo;hold your breath.&rdquo; A cough is
made by filling your chest with air, holding the folds close shut,
and then suddenly &ldquo;letting go.&rdquo; How many sounds you can
make from one tiny music box! Of course the muscles of the mouth
and throat, and the teeth and the tongue all help the voice box as
much as they can.</p>
<p>One of the best ways to keep your voice clear and strong is to
dash cold water every morning on your throat and chest, then to rub
with a coarse towel till your skin is pink and warm. Gargle your
throat with cold water if your voice is husky. Singing is very good
for you, too; but don&rsquo;t try to sing too hard. Sing easily and
gently, and see how many words you can sing without <span class=
"pagenum"><a id="page92" name="page92"></a>92</span>taking a
breath. That is good for the lung-bellows as well as the voice box.
Always sing in fresh air, but not in cold air.</p>
<p>When you talk, try to make all the words clear and distinct;
open your mouth and let the sound out. Once I had a big grown boy
in one of my classes who did not open his lips properly when he
spoke. So I asked him to prop his mouth open with a piece of stick
and then talk. I made him do it until he learned to speak much more
clearly. A famous Greek orator, named Demosthenes, who had a habit
of mumbling his words, trained himself to speak clearly by putting
pebbles in his mouth and then reciting in a loud voice.</p>
<p>When you want your voices to sound pleasant,&mdash;and that is
always, of course,&mdash;you must call on your brain to help. That
is your thinking machine. Always think twice before you let
anything unpleasant or unkind come out of your voice box. How happy
we could make everyone about us if we followed this rule!</p>
<h3 id="Ch_4_8">VIII. THINKING AND ANSWERING</h3>
<p>Suppose, as you are walking home from school to-day, you are
about to cross the street when you see an automobile coming very
fast. What do you do? You stop, of course; wait for it to go
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page93" name="page93"></a>93</span>by,
and then start on again. Why do you stop? &ldquo;Why,&rdquo; you
say, &ldquo;if I didn&rsquo;t, the automobile might run over
me.&rdquo; Something of that sort would just flash through your
mind, wouldn&rsquo;t it, in the very same second that you first saw
the automobile coming. Now, as you know, you think with your brain.
But what was it this time that set your brain to thinking?
&ldquo;Nothing,&rdquo; you say, &ldquo;I just saw the automobile
coming.&rdquo; And that is true in a way: you didn&rsquo;t need
anything more than your eyes to tell you.</p>
<p>But how did your eyes get the message to your brain, and how did
your brain tell your legs to stop walking? We must have in our
bodies a kind of telephone system. And that is, in fact, just what
we have. Our <em>brain</em> is our &ldquo;central office&rdquo;;
and our <em>nerves</em> are the wires, running from all parts of
our body to the brain, carrying messages back and forth.</p>
<p>An old man and an old woman lived out on the very edge of a
little town. One day their house caught fire and was blazing away
before they noticed it. They rushed to their neighbor&rsquo;s
telephone and rang up &ldquo;Central&rdquo; to tell her to
&ldquo;phone&rdquo; for the firemen and hose cart. <em>Kling
a-ling-a-ling!</em> went their bell, but no &ldquo;Central&rdquo;
answered; and while a man was running to town <span class=
"pagenum"><a id="page94" name="page94"></a>94</span>to get the
firemen, the fire got such a good start that the house burned
down.</p>
<p>You can see from this why we need a central office in good
working order, when we use the &ldquo;phone.&rdquo; All the wires
run into the one building, and there must be some one there to
receive calls and see that they are sent out to their proper
places. In this case, you see, &ldquo;Central&rdquo; should have
been at her post to see that the message went on to the engine
house, and then the fire would have been put out
&ldquo;double-quick.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The &ldquo;central office&rdquo; of our Body Telephone System is
just as important and just as necessary to keep in good working
order. It would be very little use to have even the keenest of eyes
and the sharpest of ears, with the readiest of nerve wires to carry
their messages into the center of the body, unless we had some
<em>organ</em>, or headquarters, there for switching the messages
over to the nerves running to the right muscles to tell them what
to do. If the brain-&ldquo;Central&rdquo; should fail in its duty,
or get out of order, then the body would be in serious trouble at
once.</p>
<p>Every day we read in the papers of accidents because somebody
didn&rsquo;t think, as well as see or hear. People see cars and
automobiles coming, but don&rsquo;t give them a thought and so are
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page95" name="page95"></a>95</span>run
down and hurt. They hear the whistle of the engine at the crossing,
but drive on just the same, without seeming to have heard it at
all. They are absent-minded; the operator in the &ldquo;central
office&rdquo; seems to be off duty, or busy about something else.
But if we are going to get on in this world of cars and automobiles
and all sorts of unexpected things, we must always &ldquo;have our
wits about us,&rdquo; as the saying goes, ready to send the
messages out to the muscles in our legs and arms and fingers just
as soon as any one of our &ldquo;Five Senses&rdquo; &ldquo;rings
up&rdquo; the &ldquo;Central&rdquo; in our brain.</p>
<p>Our body wires do not look at all like telephone wires; and the
brain, if you could see it, would never suggest to you a central
office.</p>
<p>The nerves are fine white cords, the smallest ones finer than a
hair, and the largest so big and strong that you could lift the
body by it; and their branches run all over the body, to the
muscles and the blood tubes and the skin and all the other parts,
as the picture shows. You have already read how the skin can tell
you when you feel warm and when you feel cold and when something
hurts you.</p>
<p>The brain is a soft wrinkled mass, partly gray and partly white.
It is in the head; and because <span class="pagenum"><a id="page96"
name="page96"></a>96</span>it is very soft and easily hurt, Mother
Nature has put around it a strong wall, or shell, of bone&mdash;the
<em>skull</em>, or brain box. Feel your head and see how very hard
this bone is. Solomon, the Hebrew poet-king, called it the
&ldquo;golden bowl.&rdquo; I suppose he called it a
&ldquo;bowl&rdquo; because it is round like one, and
&ldquo;golden&rdquo; because it is so precious. People do not often
grow well again if the &ldquo;golden bowl&rdquo; is broken or even
cracked.</p>
<div class="figleft"><img src="images/figure30.jpg" alt=
"A diagram of the nerves from the brain through the upper body."
id="figure30" name="figure30" width="100%" />
<p>THE NERVOUS SYSTEM&mdash;OUR BODY TELEPHONE</p>
<p class="morecaption">The picture shows the brain, or
&ldquo;Central,&rdquo; and the thick nerve cord that runs down
through the backbone, and the principal nerves of the back and the
arms.</p>
</div>
<p>The big <em>nerve cable</em>, called the <em>spinal cord</em>,
that connects the brain with the rest of the body, and carries all
the messages backward and forward, runs down the back and is
protected by the backbone, or <em>spine</em>, which <span class=
"pagenum"><a id="page97" name="page97"></a>97</span>is hollow, so
that the cord can run down through it. This backbone is jointed
together so beautifully, too, that you can bend your back about and
stoop over, and carry heavy weights on your back, and yet the bony
tube still protects the cord inside. Solomon calls this the
&ldquo;silver cord,&rdquo; because it is so white and shiny that it
looks like silver. You see, our bodies are full of beautiful as
well as wonderful things.</p>
<p>Probably sometime when your teacher has asked you to recite a
poem you have all learned, someone in the class has answered,
&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t remember it,&rdquo; or has stood up and
recited the first few lines and then stopped, and thought, and
finally had to say, &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t go on.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Now what is the matter with this boy, or girl? He looks bright
enough, and you will probably remember that he was in the class
when you learned the poem. &ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; you say, &ldquo;the
poem didn&rsquo;t stay in his head.&rdquo; No, it didn&rsquo;t
&ldquo;stick&rdquo; in his memory; but why didn&rsquo;t it?</p>
<p>Some of the messages that the Five Senses carry to the brain are
answered at once, as when we move away from danger, or reach out
our hands and help ourselves to butter, or take off a shoe to shake
out a pebble. But there are other messages that do not call for an
immediate <span class="pagenum"><a id="page98" name=
"page98"></a>98</span>reply, and are just stored away for future
use in the big &ldquo;central office&rdquo; of our Body Telephone,
in what we call our <em>memory</em>. And later, when the proper
message is sent in by our eyes or ears, or other sense organs,
which reminds us of this message which they sent before, perhaps
several weeks, months, or even years ago, it wakes up the old
message stored away in the memory, and we say we
&ldquo;remember&rdquo; what happened to us, or what we learned at
that time.</p>
<p>So, when your teacher asks you to recite a certain poem, and
your ears hear the title or the first line, you recall the rest of
the verses and the lesson about it. How many things does the word
&ldquo;Christmas&rdquo; wake up out of your memory? or the sight of
soldiers marching? or the first taste of strawberries in May?</p>
<p>You think about a great many things that you never <em>do</em>.
Really you are thinking almost all the time you are awake. And
besides the messages that &ldquo;Central&rdquo; just stores away
for future use, there are a great many messages being carried back
and forth along the &ldquo;telephone system&rdquo; all the time,
that you don&rsquo;t keep track of at all&mdash;the messages that
keep the stomach and the heart and the lungs and everything in your
body working together properly.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page99" name=
"page99"></a>99</span>How are we to take care of the telephone
lines and &ldquo;Central&rdquo; of our <em>nervous system</em>?
Whatever you do to build up and help the other parts of the body
will help your brain to <em>feel</em> and <em>think</em> and
<em>remember</em>; and will help your muscles and nerves to answer
promptly and truly whatever the message may be. Plenty of good
food, plenty of sleep and fresh air, plenty of play, will keep your
nerves and brain healthy and growing.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page100" name=
"page100"></a>100</span></p>
<h2 id="Ch_5">&ldquo;ABSENT TO-DAY?&rdquo;</h2>
<h3 id="Ch_5_1">I. KEEPING WELL</h3>
<p>How many times have you been absent this term? No oftener than
you were obliged to be, I am sure; for it&rsquo;s almost as bad as
being &ldquo;put in Coventry&rdquo; to come back and hear about the
good time the rest of the class have been having, and feel that you
&ldquo;weren&rsquo;t in it.&rdquo; Of course, sometimes, when you
are not well, you have to be absent; it is best that you should be.
But it is better still to know how to keep well, so you won&rsquo;t
have to be absent, and won&rsquo;t have to miss any good times in
work or play all your life.</p>
<p>You remember that all the parts of your body are fed and
ventilated by the blood, which is pumped to them from the heart. So
long as this blood is pure and has plenty of oxygen in it, it does
good to every part of the body to which it comes. But the moment
that poisons and dirt and waste begin to pile up in the blood, then
the blood that comes to the different parts of the body may be
poisonous to them, instead of helpful.</p>
<p>Such poisons in the blood are particularly <span class=
"pagenum"><a id="page101" name="page101"></a>101</span>harmful to
the nerves and the brain, because these are among the most delicate
and sensitive of all the structures in the body.</p>
<p>Often we think of the body as a beautiful house. Now a house
does not look very beautiful when it has dust and crumbs on the
floor, buckets of greasy dishwater in the kitchen, and smoke from
the furnace in the air! You could not live in such a place. No, the
smoke must go out up the chimney, the dust and crumbs must be swept
away, the dirty water must be drained off in pipes; the house must
be not only cleaned, but kept clean all the time. This is true of
your body, too.</p>
<p>Now Mother Nature sends the smoke from the body out through the
lungs, and the crumbs and solid dirt down and out by means of the
food tube. But the waste water&mdash;how does she get rid of that?
The waste water, you remember, is in the blood vessels, mixed with
the blood. How does she get it out of the blood? She sends it
through three magic cleaners, or strainers,&mdash;the
<em>skin</em>, the <em>liver</em>, the <em>kidneys</em>.</p>
<p>That the skin is a strainer, you already know; for you know how
the skin lets out the waste water in perspiration, or sweat, and
how important it is that we keep the little holes of the
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page102" name=
"page102"></a>102</span>strainer open and clean. And you know, too,
that most of the water that passes out of the body goes first to
the kidneys.</p>
<p>The liver, however, is the largest cleaning machine of all and
has to work very hard. The blood comes to it full of foods and
poisons. This wonderful cleaner picks out the food it needs and
takes up many of the poisons, too. &ldquo;What does it do with the
poisons?&rdquo; you ask. Some of them it changes into good food,
and others it makes harmless and sends away down the food tube in a
fluid called <em>bile</em>. If we are strong and healthy, the liver
has the power to kill many of the disease germs that get into the
body. That is why sometimes, when you have had a chance to take
mumps or grippe or some other &ldquo;catching&rdquo; disease, you
don&rsquo;t take it. Your liver kills the germs, or seeds. See how
carefully Mother Nature has planned that we may be clean inside as
well as outside.</p>

<p>THE POSITION OF THE LIVER</p>
<p class="morecaption">Compare this with the diagram on <a href=
"#page26">page 26</a>, and see how the liver partly overlaps the
stomach.</p>
</div>
<p>But you must not over-work your liver. If you do, it may become
too tired to do anything <span class="pagenum"><a id="page103"
name="page103"></a>103</span>at all. Then all these poisons will
spread through the body; the skin and the whites of the eyes will
grow yellow, and you will be what is called &ldquo;bilious.&rdquo;
When this happens, the poisons go to your brain, too, and make you
feel sad; your tongue looks white instead of pink, and you have a
disagreeable taste in your mouth. Your happiness depends very much
on your liver.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How shall I keep my liver rested and in good working
order?&rdquo; By eating only sound, wholesome, pure food, and
avoiding dirty milk; by going to the toilet regularly every morning
after breakfast; by keeping your windows open and avoiding the
poisons and disease germs in foul air. Then, if you run and play
and work out of doors, so that the muscles move a great deal and
you breathe in plenty of oxygen to keep the body fires burning
briskly, that will help a great deal.</p>
<p>Last summer up in the mountains I saw a big log close by the
path. It had been sawed across so that the end was smooth. It was
brown and weather-stained, so of course I knew that it had lain
there a long time. How surprised I was to see a pile of fine fresh
sawdust on the ground beside it. As I came nearer, I saw piece
after piece of sawdust dropping, dropping, dropping, one after the
other, from a hole in the log. I <span class="pagenum"><a id=
"page104" name="page104"></a>104</span>looked into the hole, and
what do you think I saw? Hundreds of little brown ants, busy as
could be carrying the sawdust, throwing it out, and then scurrying
back to get some more. Several feet inside the log, other ants were
cutting the sawdust, hollowing out the rooms of their house; and in
another part others were getting food for the workers, and still
others taking care of the baby ants. They were all helping one
another, and whatever one ant did helped all the rest. That is the
way with the parts, or organs, of the body. When one part works
well, it helps all the rest; when one squad of tiny cells in the
muscles or liver or heart is doing its duty, like the little ants,
it helps all the other cell-workers in the body to keep
healthy.</p>
<p>If you eat proper food, you help not only your stomach but your
liver, too; for it has not so many poisons to get rid of. While you
are helping your stomach and your liver, you are helping your heart
and your brain, and so on. So what you do to help one helps
all.</p>
<p>There are, however, some poisons that the liver cannot get rid
of; but these the skin or the kidneys carry away. Have you ever
seen kidney beans? The bean is the shape of a kidney. The
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page105" name=
"page105"></a>105</span>kidneys are in the middle of your back,
packed close to your backbone, on a line with your waist. This is a
picture of them. Do you see the little tubes leading down from the
kidneys, carrying the waste water and poison down into a kind of
bag? The walls of this bag, called the <em>bladder</em>, will
stretch, and it will hold about a pint of waste water. From the
bladder a tube carries the water down out of the body.</p>
<div class="figright"><img src="images/figure32.png" alt=
"A diagram of the kidneys, ureter and bladder." id="figure32" name=
"figure32" width="100%" />
<p>THE KIDNEYS AND THE BLADDER</p>
<p class="morecaption">The large tubes are the artery and the vein
that carry blood to and from this part of the body.</p>
</div>
<p>You can help your kidney-strainers by emptying your bladder at
certain times each day. Some children have to empty the bladder
much oftener than others, but most children can form what we call
<em>regular habits</em> about it, by trying to do it at the same
times each day. If you are quite strong, five times a day is often
enough: when you first get up, at recess, at noon, at four
o&rsquo;clock, and at bedtime. Many children do it much oftener
than this; but as they grow older and the muscles grow stronger,
they slowly outgrow this trouble, if they try to form the right
habits.</p>
<p>There are many diseases of the kidneys; for, <span class=
"pagenum"><a id="page106" name="page106"></a>106</span>like the
liver, they are sometimes over-worked and do not carry the poisons
from the body. You are helping your kidneys when you drink plenty
of fresh clean water every day, and also when you play or work hard
enough to get into a good perspiration; for, as perspiring carries
out some of the poisons, it leaves less for the kidneys to pour
out. You ought to get into a good perspiration at least once every
day, or better, three or four times, if you wish to keep healthy.

bread&rdquo;; and you must earn health and happiness at the same

<h3 id="Ch_5_2">II. SOME FOES TO FIGHT</h3>
<p>You have seen that sitting or sleeping in rooms where the air is
bad, or eating the wrong kind of food, or working after you are
badly tired, will poison your blood and hinder the proper working
of that beautiful machine, your body. These poisons are made inside
your body, and you can prevent them by living healthfully and
wholesomely. But there are other poisons, which may get into the
blood from outside the body; and while it is best for you not to
think too much about these, or to worry over dangers that may never
come, yet it is well to know just enough <span class=
"pagenum"><a id="page107" name="page107"></a>107</span>about some
of them to be able to keep out of their way, as far as
possible.</p>
<p>The most dangerous form of poisons from outside the body are
those made by the germs of some rather common diseases, which,
because you can &ldquo;catch&rdquo; them from some one else who has
them, are called &ldquo;catching,&rdquo; or <em>infectious</em>, or
<em>contagious</em>.</p>
<p>Some of the germs of these &ldquo;catching&rdquo; diseases, like
the germs of typhoid fever, of which we have spoken in connection
with our drinking water, are carried in the water or milk that we
drink, or upon the food that we eat; and one of the worst carriers
of germs is the ordinary household fly.</p>
<p>Not so very many years ago, people did not know that <em>dirt
makes people sick</em>. You see, they did not know anything about
the disease seeds (germs) that grow so fast in dirt. They did not
like to have flies about, because flies look so dirty and bite
people and crawl over things and spot them. But nowadays, we will
not have flies about because we know that they have been in dirty
places where disease germs live, and that one little fly can carry
thousands and thousands of these germs on his feet.</p>
<p>Have you ever looked at a fly through a magnifying <span class=
"pagenum"><a id="page108" name="page108"></a>108</span>glass or
under a microscope? If you haven&rsquo;t, try it sometime. You will
see that his legs are covered with little hairs; and it is on these
little hairs that the germs lodge. They are too small for you to
see except with a very powerful glass; but scientists have proved
that they are there, and they have found that there are always
typhoid germs among them.</p>
<div class="figcen"><img src="images/figure33.jpg" alt=
"A diagram of a very large version of a house fly." id="figure33"
name="figure33" width="429" height="348" />
<p>THE COMMON HOUSE FLY</p>
<p>As he appears through a magnifying glass.</p>
</div>
<p>Did you ever see a fly wipe his feet before he came into the
house? No, indeed; and he goes anywhere he pleases, over the bread
and into the cream. Yet he was born in dirt and bred in dirt, and
he lives in dirty places all the time he is not crawling over your
clean things and spoiling them.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page109" name=
"page109"></a>109</span>Flies are hatched from eggs; and these eggs
can hatch only in piles of dirt, such as heaps of manure, or places
where garbage and scraps from the house are dumped or thrown. We
call the common fly the "domestic" or "house" fly, because he lives
only in the neighborhood of houses and barnyards where heaps of
manure and piles of dirt are allowed to gather.</p>
<p>When the fly first hatches from the egg, it is a little white,
wriggling worm called a <em>maggot</em>, like those that some of
you may have seen in decaying meat or fish or cheese. The maggots
must have decaying substances to eat and live upon while they are
growing, and this is why the eggs are laid in manure heaps and
garbage piles.</p>
<div class="figright"><a href="images/figure34.png"><img src=
"images/figure34.png" alt=
"A diagram of a finger-like worm emerging from a disc." id=
"figure34" name="figure34" width="100%" /></a>
<p>A MAGGOT HATCHING FROM THE EGG</p>
<p>(Greatly magnified.)</p>
</div>
<p>It takes the maggot about five days to grow to its full size,
and then it turns into a <em>chrysalis</em>. That is, it is shut up
in a kind of case that it has spun for itself, like the cocoon of
the silkworm or the caterpillar. In about five days more it breaks
out of this cocoon and appears as a fly with wings.</p>
<p>So, you see, the eggs must stay in that manure heap about two
weeks if they are to hatch. If, <span class="pagenum"><a id=
"page110" name="page110"></a>110</span>within that time, the manure
is carted away and thrown out somewhere where it will dry, the
little unhatched flies will be killed, or prevented from hatching.
All we have to do, then, to be entirely rid of flies about our
houses is to see that the heaps of manure and all piles of cans and
garbage are taken away at least once a week.</p>
<div class="figleft"><img src="images/figure35.png" alt=
"An illustration; the maggots are each about twice the size of the printed letters."
id="figure35" name="figure35" width="100%" />
<p>FLY MAGGOTS ON OLD NEWSPAPER</p>
<p class="morecaption">Note the size of the maggot compared with
the newspaper type.</p>
</div>
<p>If manure heaps or piles of dirt cannot, for any reason, be
carried away as often as this, then they can be sprinkled with
something that is poisonous to flies, such as arsenic or kerosene.
This will kill the maggots. If we keep every kind of waste and
scraps from the house, and all the manure from the barn and the
pig-pen and the hen-house carefully cleaned up, or sprinkled with
some poison, we shall get rid of flies entirely and never need to
use screens at the doors and windows. Until we do this, it is best
to put screens at the doors and <span class="pagenum"><a id=
"page111" name="page111"></a>111</span>windows in the summer time,
and particularly to screen carefully any place where food is kept
or cooked; for we know that a great many cases of typhoid and of
other diseases of the stomach and bowels, such as <em>summer
sickness</em>, or summer <em>diarrhea</em>, and <em>cholera
morbus</em>, are carried to our food by the dirty feet of
flies.</p>
<p>Many of the germs of &ldquo;catching&rdquo; diseases&mdash;most
of them, in fact&mdash;are carried in the air, in scales that have
rubbed off the skin of the persons sick with them, or in spray that
they have coughed into the air, or in saliva that they have spit
upon the floor.</p>
<p>There is one sickness of this kind that I ought to tell you
about, because it kills so many thousand people here in our own
country every year. We sometimes call it the &ldquo;Great White
Plague.&rdquo; Its common name is <em>consumption</em>, and the
doctors call it <em>tuberculosis</em>. I dare say you have heard of
it and wondered what it meant.</p>
<p>A few years ago people thought it could not be cured. They
thought that children had it because their parents had had it
before them. But now, the cheering thing about it is that we have
found that Mother Nature herself can cure it with fresh air and
sunshine and wholesome food. We have found, too, that people catch
it <span class="pagenum"><a id="page112" name=
"page112"></a>112</span>from others who are sick with it, and need
not have it just because their parents did.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page113" name=
"page113"></a>113</span></p>
<div class="figfull"><img src="images/figure36.jpg" alt=
"Hospital beds outdoors on the ledge of a building." id="figure36"
name="figure36" width="100%" />
<p>FRESH AIR AND SUNLIGHT ARE GOOD DOCTORS</p>
</div>
<p>This means, then, that thousands of people who have it need not
die, but can be cured simply by living and sleeping out of doors
and eating plenty of milk, eggs, and meat, nuts and fruit. There
are camps for them in almost every state in the Union now. The
fresh air gives them such a big appetite that they can eat more
than most healthy people, and they soon get strong and well.</p>
<p>If all the people who now have consumption were taken out into
the country and cured, there would be no one left for the rest of
us to catch it from, and the disease would soon die. Some day our
Boards of Health will decide to do this, and then consumption will
become as rare as smallpox is now, and will kill only a few hundred
people a year in the United States instead of 150,000 every year,
as it does now.</p>
<p>People and governments are giving great sums of money, not only
to cure the people who now have consumption, but to do something
towards stopping the disease by keeping things so clean and people
so strong that no one will ever have it. Even little children can
help to fight and kill this &ldquo;Great White Plague,&rdquo; and
I&rsquo;ll tell you how.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page114" name=
"page114"></a>114</span>We know that, when people have consumption
in their lungs, what they cough and spit out of their mouths and
blow out of their noses (we call it <em>sputum</em>) has the germs,
or seeds, of the disease in it. So, to keep other people from
catching the disease, they must hold something before the face when
they cough, and they must catch the sputum in paper (newspapers or
paper napkins are very good for this) and burn it, for burning
kills the germs. Then, too, they must not kiss other people on the
mouth, and others must not kiss them. They must use their own
drinking-cups, and never lend or borrow a cup. You see, you can
look out for these things, yourselves. When grown people kiss you,
just turn your cheek to them, instead of your mouth. Your cheek
will not carry anything to your windpipe and lungs. And be sure to
carry your own drinking-cup, or, better still, make the one for
which you already have the pattern, every time you need one.</p>
<div class="figleft"><img src="images/figure37.png" alt=
"A drawing of a boy with a towel over his shoulder and a cup in his hand."
id="figure37" name="figure37" width="143" height="311" />
<p>HIS OWN CUP AND TOWEL</p>
</div>
<p>This sounds easy enough; and it is, too. But sometimes people
don&rsquo;t know when they have this &ldquo;plague,&rdquo; and of
course they do not feel <span class="pagenum"><a id="page115" name=
"page115"></a>115</span>that they must be careful. What is to be
done, then?</p>
<p>If people won&rsquo;t take care of themselves, then the
government has to make health laws to protect them, and the health
officers have to see that the laws are obeyed. In many of the
states and cities, laws have been made so that nobody is allowed to
spit on the sidewalk or in the cars or in any other public place;
and common drinking-cups are forbidden at all park fountains and at
the water-coolers in schools and trains and stations and other
public places.</p>
<p>You ought to know about these things, because, as I have just
said, other sicknesses, too, are carried about in the nose and
mouth. <em>Grippe</em>, <em>pneumonia</em> or lung fever, and what
we call <em>colds</em> are caught in exactly the same way. We used
to think we caught them by being chilled; but we are much more
likely to take them by being shut up in a hot, stuffy room with
other people who already have them. Mother Nature never gave us
such things in her beautiful, clean outdoors. We must wear clothes
enough to keep us warm when we go out, and have bedclothes enough
to keep us warm while we sleep; but we need not be afraid of
catching any sickness from the clean outside air, either by day or
by night. Drafts <span class="pagenum"><a id="page116" name=
"page116"></a>116</span>are not dangerous, except when our blood is
already full of poisons and germs from foul air.</p>
<p>Of course it is foolish even for strong, healthy people to run
any risks that can be avoided, and there is one other thing that
you should keep on the watch against doing; and that is, touching
or kissing or playing with other children who may be sick. It is
better not even to sit in the same room with them if you can avoid
it.</p>
<p>Many of the infectious diseases&mdash;and nearly three fourths
of all the diseases that children have are infectious&mdash;are
caught, as we have seen, from germs that are carried in the air.
That is one reason why so many infectious diseases are likely to
begin with running at the nose, or sneezing, or cold in the head,
or sore throat. The germs, having been breathed in with the air,
catch on the sides of the nostrils or at the back of the throat,
and start inflammation and soreness wherever they land. This is
just the way that <em>measles</em>, <em>scarlet fever</em>,
<em>chicken pox</em>, <em>whooping cough</em>, and
<em>diphtheria</em> begin. Nearly all colds in the head, and sore
throats with coughing, are infectious; so the best thing to do
whenever you have a bad cold in the head, or a sore throat, is to
keep out in the open air as much as you can, until it is better. Of
course, a cold is not such a serious <span class="pagenum"><a id=
"page117" name="page117"></a>117</span>thing in itself; but, if it
is neglected, it may lead to some very dangerous troubles,
particularly to inflammation of the lungs, and sometimes even of
the kidneys or the liver or the heart. Several of these infectious
diseases&mdash;measles, chicken pox, and scarlet fever, for
instance&mdash;have a rash, or breaking-out, called an
<em>eruption</em>, upon the skin. This is another thing easy to
look out for; and if you see anyone with a rash upon his face and
hands, it is a good thing to keep away from him and not let him
touch you. Even if he should not have measles or scarlet fever or
chicken pox, but only a disease of the skin itself, he still might
spread the infection of that; for most diseases that cause a
breaking-out upon the surface of the skin are infectious.</p>
<p>Some of these infectious diseases are so common among children
that they are called <em>Children&rsquo;s Diseases</em>, or the
<em>Diseases of Infancy</em>, just as if it were natural for you to
have them while you are children, and as if they were something
that you have to have as a matter of course, before you grow
up.</p>
<p>But it isn&rsquo;t necessary at all to have them, if you will
take care of yourselves and help your doctors and the Board of
Health of your county or town or city to prevent their spreading.
These <span class="pagenum"><a id="page118" name=
"page118"></a>118</span>diseases, although usually very mild, never
do anyone any good whatever, and may do serious harm; for their
poisons may stay in the blood and injure the heart or the kidneys
or the nerves.</p>
<p>One thing I should like to urge you to do if you happen to get
one of these &ldquo;children&rsquo;s diseases&rdquo;; and that is,
to stay in bed or out of school or away from work just as long as
your doctor tells you to. This is important, because it is very
dangerous indeed to become over-tired or overheated or chilled, or
to get your feet wet or romp too hard or sit up too late, before
you have fully recovered; and you will not have fully recovered
until at least three or four weeks after you are able to be out of
bed. But if you take good care of yourselves for three or four
weeks after measles or chicken pox or whooping cough or a very bad
cold, you will avoid almost all danger of their poisons injuring
your heart or kidneys or nerves, and causing chronic diseases, like
Bright&rsquo;s disease or heart disease, later in life.</p>
<p>Perhaps now I have told you enough about poisons and sickness.
You must not be frightened about them. I have told you these things
so that you may understand why you must bathe, and brush your
teeth, and wash your face and hands, and wear clean clothes, and
breathe fresh air, <span class="pagenum"><a id="page119" name=
"page119"></a>119</span>and keep your windows open, and play out of
doors&mdash;in fact, keep your bodies clean inside and out. I know
you will be glad enough to do these things, troublesome though some
of them may be, if you know the reason why. The best of it is that
when you keep perfectly clean and healthy, not even the
&ldquo;Great White Plague&rdquo; and cold seeds, or germs, can hurt
you, even though they get into your mouth or nose; for Mother
Nature gives healthy bodies the power to kill germs, and quite
without our knowing it.</p>

<p>ENJOYING &ldquo;ALL OUTDOORS&rdquo;</p>
<p>Very discouraging to disease germs!</p>
</div>
<h3 id="Ch_5_3">III. PROTECTING OUR FRIENDS</h3>
<p>If you knew that some of your little friends were sick with an
infectious disease like measles <span class="pagenum"><a id=
"page120" name="page120"></a>120</span>or scarlet fever, of course
you would keep away from them, so as to avoid catching the disease.
And if they knew that they had a disease that was infectious, of
course they would want to let all their friends know of it, so as
to prevent them from coming and catching it. But how can they let
all their friends know? Sick people don&rsquo;t feel like writing
letters; and, even if they did, some diseases can be carried in
letters. So that might not be at all a friendly thing to do.</p>
<p>This has always been the greatest difficulty in preventing the
spread of infectious diseases&mdash;how to let other people know.
So about fifty or sixty years ago, people got together and decided
that the best thing to do was to appoint an officer known as a
<em>Health Officer</em>, or a committee known as a <em>Board of
Health</em>, in each town and in each county, whose business it
should be to find out cases of infectious disease, and to warn
other people against them.</p>
<p>These officers first ask all the doctors in the town to report
to this Central Health Office, or Board of Health, every case of a
patient with an infectious disease. Then, when the case has been
reported, that office sends some one with a card on which the name
of the disease is printed in large letters, and he tacks the card
upon the front <span class="pagenum"><a id="page121" name=
"page121"></a>121</span>of the house or upon the fence around the
lot, so that everyone who goes near the house may know that there
is danger, and keep away from it. Then, sometimes, a messenger from
the Board of Health goes into the house and talks to the family,
and tells them how they can keep the patient in a room by himself,
so as to prevent the rest of the family from catching the disease;
and how they can best take care of the patient, and keep from
carrying the infection through clothing or food or anything
else.</p>
<div class="figcen"><img src="images/figure39.jpg" alt=
"A form with SCARLET FEVER in large letters on it." id="figure39"
name="figure39" width="537" height="362" />
<p>ONE WAY IN WHICH THE BOARD OF HEALTH PROTECTS US</p>
</div>
<p>Then, because anyone who has been sick with an infectious
disease will still be shedding the germs of the disease and
spitting or coughing, <span class="pagenum"><a id="page122" name=
"page122"></a>122</span>not only as long as he is sick, but for two
or three weeks after he is beginning to feel better, the messenger
will tell the family that the patient must stay either in his own
room or within his own house or yard, for so many days or weeks.
This is called keeping <em>quarantine</em>. The word comes from the
Italian word <em>quaranta</em>, &ldquo;forty&rdquo;; because in the
early days when the practice was first begun, the patients used to
be kept by themselves in this way for forty days. While sometimes
this is very inconvenient and hard and troublesome, it is really
the only safe way of stopping the spread of these diseases; and I
am sure anyone of you would be willing to take this extra trouble
sooner than let any of your friends catch a disease from you, and
perhaps die of it. Quarantine is also the best and safest thing for
the patient, because it keeps him quiet and at rest until he has
completely recovered, and until all danger that the poison of the
disease will attack his lungs or heart or kidneys is over.</p>
<p>In some of the best schools now there is an examination of all
the children every morning, by a visiting doctor sent by the Board
of Health. If the doctor finds any child that has red and watery
eyes, or is running at the nose, or sneezing, or coughing, or has a
sore throat, he usually sends <span class="pagenum"><a id="page123"
name="page123"></a>123</span>him home at once, so that the other
children will not catch the infection. The school doctor is not
thinking only about what seems to be a cold, although, as you know,
it is very important that anyone with a cold should take good care
of himself and should not let others catch it from him. The doctor
sends the child home because this is just the way in which several
other infectious diseases may begin&mdash;<em>measles</em>,
<em>scarlet fever</em>, <em>chicken pox</em>, <em>whooping
cough</em>, and <em>diphtheria</em>. For most infectious diseases,
as you will remember, are caught from germs floating in the air and
breathed into the nose and throat.</p>
<p>The Board of Health takes care of the public in many ways
besides these. It keeps a very careful watch upon the water supply
of the town, or city, so as to keep the houses and factories from
running their drainage, or <em>sewage</em>, into it; for this, as
you already know, might cause the spread of typhoid fever and of
other diseases of the bowels and stomach.</p>
<p>The Board of Health sends men to examine, or inspect, the milk
the dairymen bring, to see that it is sweet and pure, and that
there are no infectious germs in it. And it sends men out into the
country to examine the dairy farms and see that the cows are
properly fed, and that the barns <span class="pagenum"><a id=
"page124" name="page124"></a>124</span>in which they are milked are
kept clean; and that the water in which the milk pans and bottles

<p>WHAT MILK INSPECTION MEANS</p>
<p>Clean barns, cows, pails, and milkers mean clean milk. The cows
here stand in fresh, clean sawdust.</p>
</div>
<p>Another thing that the Board of Health does is to send an
inspector round to look very carefully at all the meat that is sold
in the butcher shops, and at all the fruits and vegetables at the
grocers&rsquo;. If he finds any meat that is diseased or tainted or
bad, or any fruit or vegetables that are beginning to spoil, or any
flour, sugar, or canned goods that have been mixed with cheaper
stuffs that are not good to eat,&mdash;in fact, are what the
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page125" name=
"page125"></a>125</span>law calls <em>adulterated</em>,&mdash;he
may seize the bad and dangerous foods and destroy them, and summon
to court the dealers who are trying to sell them. Then the dealers
are fined or perhaps sent to prison.</p>
<p>So, you see, the Board of Health is one of the very best friends
that you have, trying to keep your food pure and good, the water
that you drink clean and wholesome, and the milk sweet and free
from dirt or disease germs. You ought to help these officers and
their inspectors in every way that you can. I know that it is
sometimes troublesome to obey all their rules; and perhaps when you
don&rsquo;t know what the dangers are which they are trying to
guard you against, it seems to you that they are too particular
about a great many things. But just see what they have done already
to make our cities and houses healthier and pleasanter places to
live in.</p>
<p>Only one hundred and fifty years ago, for instance, that
terrible disease called <em>smallpox</em> killed hundreds of
thousands of people every year in Europe; and it attacked the eyes
and blinded so many of those who recovered from it, that nearly
half the poor blind people in the blind asylums had had their sight
destroyed by it. In smallpox there is a terrible eruption, or
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page126" name=
"page126"></a>126</span>breaking out, upon the skin, which is
likely to leave it pitted and scarred; and even fifty years ago it
was exceedingly common to see people who had been pitted by
smallpox, or, as the expression was, &ldquo;pock-marked.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Cows have a disease somewhat like this, but much less dangerous,
called cow-pox. Years ago, before dairies were inspected as they
are now, dairy maids often caught this disease from the cows they
milked, so that their hands would break out with pock-marks.</p>
<p>About a hundred years ago, a Dr. Richard Jenner discovered that
the dairy maids in the country district in which he lived, who had
caught this mild infection from the cows they milked, never caught
smallpox even when they were exposed to it. So after studying over
the subject for some years, he took a little of the matter, or pus,
from the eruption on the udder of a cow that had cow-pox, scratched
the arm of a little patient of his, and rubbed some of the pus into
it. Only a short time after, the family of this little boy was
exposed to smallpox, and all the other children took it badly, but
he escaped.</p>
<p>This was the beginning of what we call <em>vaccination</em>; and
as soon as it was found that this scratching of the arm and putting
a little of this <span class="pagenum"><a id="page127" name=
"page127"></a>127</span><em>vaccine</em> matter into it would cause
only a few days of feverishness, and then after that give complete
protection against smallpox, the Boards of Health all over the
civilized world took it up and insisted upon everybody&rsquo;s
being vaccinated when a baby.</p>
<p>As a result, smallpox has become one of the rarest, instead of
the commonest, of our infectious diseases. Only a few dozen people
die of it each year in Europe, instead of several hundred
thousands; scarcely one one-hundredth of the people now in our
blind asylums have been sent there by smallpox, and I dare say that
many of you have never even seen a pock-marked person.</p>
<p>Another disease that used to be very dangerous to little
children is <em>diphtheria</em>. It was not only very infectious,
but very deadly; and nearly half of the children who took it died
of it, and the doctors didn&rsquo;t know anything that would cure
it. About twenty years ago, two great scientists, one a Frenchman
named Roux&mdash;a student of the great Professor Louis Pasteur, of
whom I am sure you have heard&mdash;and the other, a German, named
Behring, discovered an <em>antitoxin</em> for diphtheria; that is,
something to defeat the poison of the diphtheria germ. When this
antitoxin is injected into the blood, it will cure diphtheria.</p>
<p>The doctors and the Boards of Health took <span class=
"pagenum"><a id="page128" name="page128"></a>128</span>this up too,
and insisted upon its being used in all cases; with the result that
where the antitoxin is used early, scarcely one in twenty of the
patients dies, instead of eight or ten out of twenty, as
before.</p>
<p>You know how careful we are all trying to be not to let
consumption spread. By insisting that all houses shall be built so
as to give plenty of light and fresh air to everyone; and by
forbidding spitting upon the streets; and by insisting that food to
be sold, especially milk, shall be clean,&mdash;by preventing the
spread of the disease in every way, our Boards of Health have cut
down the number of deaths from this disease nearly one half; and
people in the United States, for instance, or in England, where
these health laws are enforced, live now almost exactly twice as
long on the average as they did one hundred years ago, or as they
do now in India and in Turkey, for instance, where the people are
ignorant and dirty and careless.</p>
<p>So you see that even if some of the health regulations do seem
rather troublesome and fussy, it is well worth while to try to
follow them and help the health inspectors in every way. Even
little children can help very much in keeping the houses and the
cities in which they live clean and healthful and beautiful.</p>

<p>BETTER TO TAKE THAN MEDICINE</p>
</div>
<p>When school is over, out you go with a rush, into the open air.
You have worked hard all day, and now you have two hours before
supper to do just as you like.</p>
<p>Perhaps you will play tag, or prisoner&rsquo;s base, or stealing
sticks, or town ball. They are all fine fun, and they exercise
every muscle in your body and make your lungs breathe deeper and
your heart beat faster, and make every part of you grow
stronger.</p>
<p>Perhaps you have a few chores to do or errands to run; but even
these are almost as much fun as play and give you good exercise in
the open air and, what is better still, a feeling that you are
being of some use in the world, which is one of the happiest and
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page130" name=

ever have, if you live to be a hundred years old.</p>

<p>OUT FOR AN AFTERNOON IN THE PARK</p>
</div>
<p>But when you have finished your work, you must not forget to
play real, lively, jolly games out of doors&mdash;ball and tag and
hide-and-seek, and all those games that children love.</p>
<p>Hide-and-seek is a good game, because, when you are caught, you
can stand still a few minutes and rest. When you are hiding, you
can take a good breath for the home-run you have to make. Most
games, in fact, are planned like this&mdash;a run and a rest, and
then another run. While you rest, some one else is taking his turn
at the bat, or at being &ldquo;It,&rdquo; or whatever is the
hardest part of the work. This is one reason why games are so good
for you to play.</p>
<div class="figleft"><img src="images/figure43.jpg" alt=
"A drawing of a skeleton" id="figure43" name="figure43" width=
"100%" />
<p>SKELETON OF A MAN</p>
</div>
<p>You see, when you run, you are working your muscles and
heart-pump very hard; and if you kept running all the time, you
would burn up so much food in the muscles that the heart
couldn&rsquo;t pump blood fast enough to wash away all the waste,
and would just chug-chug-chug till it tired itself out. When you
are tired, it is time to stop and rest; for being tired means that
the poisons are not being carried away from the muscles fast
enough, and that your heart is working too hard.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page132" name=
"page132"></a>132</span>What is it in your body that gives it
stiffening to stand upright, and makes levers in your legs and arms
to move it about? When you feel your body and arms and head with
your fingers, what are they like? Isn&rsquo;t there something hard
and then a soft kind of pad over it? We call the hard things
<em>bones</em>. Your teacher will show you some. These are white
and chalky looking; but when they were alive, they were a beautiful
pinkish white color.</p>
<p>So you have a pretty pearl-colored framework, the shape of your
body. This, which is called your <em>skeleton</em>, makes you stiff
enough to stand up and walk about. <span class="pagenum"><a id=
"page133" name="page133"></a>133</span>Now bend your arm and turn
your wrist and open and close your hand. You find that your
frame-work is jointed. When you are tired standing, you can bend
your joints and sit down. If you want an apple, you can close your
fingers and pick it up.</p>

<p>THE MUSCLES OF THE ARM</p>
</div>
<p>What are the soft pads that you felt over the bones of your arms
and legs? Stretch your right arm straight out in front of you and
take hold of the upper part of it with your left hand. Now clench
your right fist and bring it toward your shoulder. Can you feel the
elastic pads, or bands, moving? What are they doing? They are
pulling your hand up to your shoulder. <span class="pagenum"><a id=
"page134" name="page134"></a>134</span>When you walk, you can feel
the elastic bands moving your legs along. So every move we make,
these elastic ropes are at work pulling us about and letting us sit
down and making us run and jump. We call them <em>muscles</em>.</p>
<div class="figright"><img src="images/figure45.png" alt=
"A diagram of an arm with elbow bent." id="figure45" name=
"figure45" width="100%" />
<p>WHEN THE MUSCLES SHORTEN</p>
</div>
<p>You have perhaps seen jointed dolls. The strings and rubber
bands on their joints help to make them move; but the dolls
don&rsquo;t act as if they were alive. They have no telephone
system to tell their bodies how to move.</p>
<p>If you will stop and think how many &ldquo;moves&rdquo; you make
in a day, you&rsquo;ll know how hard your muscles have to work.
They&rsquo;d be quite tired out if they did not have plenty to feed
on all the time and did not rest at least nine hours a day. I told
you how the food is melted and carried about in the blood. It is
the blood that brings the muscles their food and keeps them alive
and makes them strong enough to move the joints and the bones.</p>
<p>What does all this playing do for you? It makes you grow not
only big, but strong, too. What puny little things you&rsquo;d be
if you couldn&rsquo;t get out and run and play and make your
muscles strong and your nerves do just what you tell them to
do.</p>
<p>I know of ten or twelve little chickens that <span class=
"pagenum"><a id="page135" name="page135"></a>135</span>hatched a
few weeks ago. There are so many cats about, that the poor little
chicks have to be shut up in the barn all day. At first they ran
and played and jumped on their mother&rsquo;s back, but now they
hump their shoulders and hang their heads and don&rsquo;t seem
hungry and look sad and sick. They are not so big as some that
hatched later. Can you tell me why? Of course you can. You know
that it is outdoor exercise and play that chickens need, and that
you need to make you grow big and strong, too. Of course, you will
have to keep your backbone straight and your chest out and your
head up; but all these things will be easy for you if you are
perfectly well and strong.</p>

<p>A SKATING POND MADE OUT OF A GARDEN</p>
<p>The school garden is flooded in winter&mdash;a fine place to
skate right after school.</p>
</div>
<p>The school tries to take just as good care of your health and
growth as it can. Your lessons are short, and you change from one
to another frequently, with perhaps drills or calisthenic exercises
between, so that you need not sit still too long at a time; and the
seats and desks are of different sizes so that you need not sit at
a desk that does not fit you. When your teacher urges you to go out
of doors and play at recess time, even if you do not want to, you
must think to yourself, &ldquo;It will rest me and make me grow big
and straight and strong.&rdquo;</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page136" name=
"page136"></a>136</span>When you come home from school, go out of
doors and stay out just as long as you can. Don&rsquo;t let dolls
or toys or picture books tempt you to stay in the house. The
pictures out of doors are ever so much prettier, as soon as you
learn to see them. But some of you live in crowded cities. I hope
you are near a park or a playground, where you can have a good romp
with other children, and use the swings and see-saws and bars, and
the skating pond in winter, and the swimming pool in summer.</p>

<p>SPLENDID EXERCISE FOR LUNGS AND MUSCLES</p>
</div>
<p>What fun swimming is! You can learn easily if you have a safe
place and an older person to teach you the stroke. You can roll
over on your back in the water, and float, and dive; but you
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page137" name=
"page137"></a>137</span>must not stay in longer than twenty
minutes, and not so long as that sometimes. As soon as you begin to
feel chilly, come out. Swimming not only cleans your skin, but is
splendid exercise for your lungs and muscles.</p>
<p>All this play out of doors will help your appetite, and that
will make you ready to eat the right kind of food, and this food
will get into your blood and keep your muscles firm and strong.</p>
<h3 id="Ch_6_2">II. ACCIDENTS</h3>
<p>I am going to tell you what to do in the case of some of the
little accidents that may happen to anyone, and especially of the
kind that children meet with in playing; but I don&rsquo;t want you
to stop playing for fear you&rsquo;ll be hurt. Mother <span class=
"pagenum"><a id="page138" name="page138"></a>138</span>Nature can
usually heal all the bumps and cuts and scratches that come from
wholesome play.</p>
<p>You can, however, help her very much by keeping the
<em>scratch</em> or <em>cut perfectly clean</em>. This is the chief
thing to remember. Wash it thoroughly in clean water. Hold it under
the pump, or faucet, and let the water pour down on it.</p>
<p>If you can, pour some <em>antiseptic</em>, or germ killer, over
the cut, and wrap it up in a clean cloth. There is a medicine
called <em>peroxid of hydrogen</em>, which is good for cuts and
wounds, but an older person will have to put it on for you.</p>
<p>If the scratch is from a finger nail or the claw of a cat, or if
the wound is the bite of some animal, you must be sure to have your
mother or a doctor clean the wound with strong medicine. You see,
nails and claws and teeth are, as a rule, dirty, and have on them
germs that will get into the cut and make it swell and be very sore
indeed.</p>
<div class="figleft"><img src="images/figure48.png" alt=
"A drawing of an arm with a bandage on it." id="figure48" name=
"figure48" width="179" height="338" />
<p>THE TIGHT BANDAGE HIGHER THAN THE CUT</p>
</div>
<p>Sometime you may have a cut that is deep. You will see the
bright red blood spurt from it. This means that you have cut one
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page139" name=
"page139"></a>139</span>of the blood pipes called arteries. If the
cut is on the arm or the leg, you should take a cloth or bandage
and tie it tightly around the arm or leg <em>above</em> the cut;
and if that does not check the blood, put a piece of stick under
the cloth and twist the stick, as in the picture. For a cut like
this you must get help as soon as possible, and keep quiet, or else
you will increase the flow of blood.</p>
<p>If you get anything in your eye, be sure not to rub the eye;
don&rsquo;t even wink hard if you can help it. You will only make
the pain worse, because you will scratch the eyeball. Let some one
take out the bit of dust or the cinder or the fly, or whatever it
is, as quickly as possible. Often, if you close the lids gently and
hold them so, the tears will wash the speck down for you.</p>
<p>If you should bruise yourself, the best way to treat the bruise
is to pour either quite cold or quite warm water over it, and keep
this up for several minutes; or to put it into a bowl of hot water.
Then tie it up in a bandage of soft cotton cloth or gauze and pour
over it a lotion containing a little alcohol&mdash;about one sixth
or one fourth. This, by evaporating, cools off the bruise and
relieves the pain.</p>
<p>If your ear, or nose, or a finger should happen to be frozen or
frost bitten, the best thing to do <span class="pagenum"><a id=
"page140" name="page140"></a>140</span>is to rub it hard with snow
until it thaws out and becomes pink again. Above all, don&rsquo;t
go too near the fire, and don&rsquo;t go into a very warm room too
soon.</p>
<p>If you get one of those uncomfortable itchy swellings on your
feet called <em>chilblains</em>, which come from cold floors in
your houses, or from wet feet, or from wearing too thin shoes and
stockings, don&rsquo;t put your feet too near the fire, but rub
them well with turpentine just before going to bed at night. This
will often take all the pain and itching out of them.</p>
<p>Sometimes people make the mistake of drinking something that is
poisonous. Of course, one good way to prevent this is to have
<em>every bottle in the house carefully marked</em> and never to
take anything from a bottle without reading the mark, or label.
Another good way is <em>not to have poisons about</em> any more
than we actually need to.</p>
<p>Still, even so, sometimes a mistake is made. If you ever make
such a mistake, the best thing to do is to drink as much warm water
as you can, and into the second cupful to put a tablespoonful of
dry mustard or two heaping tablespoonfuls of salt. This will make
you vomit, and up will come the poison. The water makes the poison
weaker. If this doesn&rsquo;t make you throw up the poison,
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page141" name=
"page141"></a>141</span>have some one tickle the back of your
throat with a feather. There are a great many kinds of poison and
as many things to take to cure them; but this is the only remedy I
shall tell you about, because, by the time you have tried this,
some older person will probably have come to help you.</p>
<p>All the medicines that you see advertised as &ldquo;Headache
Cures&rdquo; are dangerous poisons if taken in too large doses; and
most of them in small doses weaken the heart. They are what we call
narcotics; they just deaden the nerves to pain without doing
anything whatever to relieve or remove the cause.</p>
<p>If you have a headache, the best thing to do is to go and lie
down quietly and rest or sleep, until it goes away. A headache
always means that something is wrong; it is one of Nature&rsquo;s
most valuable danger signals. When your head aches, Nature is
telling you that you have been over-straining your eyes, or
breathing foul air, or eating some food that does not agree with
you, or forgetting to go to the toilet regularly, or not getting
sleep enough. The sensible thing to do is not to swallow some
medicine to deaden your nerves to the pain, but to find out what
you have been doing that is unhealthful for you, and then stop
it.</p>
<p>Most of the medicines called &ldquo;patent medicines,&rdquo;
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page142" name=
"page142"></a>142</span>which are advertised to &ldquo;cure&rdquo;
all sorts of pains and troubles, contain poisons, and are
particularly dangerous because they easily lead one to form the
habit of taking them. Nine tenths of them are either absolute
frauds,&mdash;of no strength or use whatever,&mdash;or else they
contain alcohol, or opium, or some of the dangerous drugs made out
of coal tar.</p>
<p>Now about <em>burns</em>. You need not wash them, because the
heat has killed the troublesome germs. They need to be covered from
the air, if the blister is broken. Cover them thickly with olive
oil or vaseline, or common baking soda mixed with a few drops of
water. This makes a good paste to put over them, and it will ease
the pain. (This is the way to treat a <em>wasp</em> or <em>bee
sting</em>, too, after you have pulled out the
&ldquo;stinger.&rdquo;) If the blister of the burn is not broken,
just keep putting vaseline or sweet oil on it every half hour or
so, and the blister won&rsquo;t break; for the oil will make it
limber and prevent it from bursting.</p>
<p>If ever your clothes should catch fire, <em>do not run</em>; the
wind you make will only fan the flames, so that they burn faster.
<em>Lie down and roll over and over</em>, as fast as you can. If
there is a rug or a quilt handy, wrap yourself up tight in it. My
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page143" name=
"page143"></a>143</span>youngest brother once saved a little
child&rsquo;s life this way. He was not very old, but he remembered
to put the child on the floor and roll him up in a rug.</p>
<p>However, the best way to prevent accidents with fire is to let
fire and lamps and matches and kerosene and sparklers and
firecrackers alone.</p>
<p>I am so glad that people are becoming sensible about keeping our
nation&rsquo;s birthday, the Fourth of July, and are doing away
with the firecrackers that have killed so many thousands of
children. The burns you get from firecrackers are much more
dangerous than other burns. A dirt-germ often gets into them that
may cause <em>lockjaw</em>. The name tells what it is: it locks the
jaws together so that its victim cannot eat; and, of course, if he
cannot eat, he cannot live very long. Next Fourth of July try
getting flags and bunting and drums and horns, if you like, instead
of these dangerous fireworks.</p>
<p>In keeping the Fourth one year not long ago, one hundred and
seventy-one children lost one or more fingers; forty-one lost a
leg, an arm, or a hand; thirty-six lost one eye, and sixteen lost
both eyes; and two hundred and fifteen children were killed! This
accounts for only the children; counting everybody, five thousand
three hundred <span class="pagenum"><a id="page144" name=
"page144"></a>144</span>and seven people were killed or hurt. No
wonder we begin to think that we ought to keep the Fourth in some
other way.</p>
<div class="figleft"><img src="images/figure49.png" alt=
"A boy lies in bed with a bandage over his eyes." id="figure49"

<p>A RESULT OF CELEBRATING THE FOURTH IN THE OLD WAY</p>
</div>
<p>In the City of Washington, on one Fourth of July, one hundred
and four people were taken to the hospital; but the following year
when no fireworks were allowed to be sold, the hospitals did not
have a single patient from the accidents of the day.</p>
<p>Water, as well as fire, has its dangers. If you ever fall into
the water, <em>be sure to keep your mouth shut and your hands below
your chin</em>. Then paddle with your hands gently, and
you&rsquo;ll swim, just as any other young animal does when first
thrown into the water. Even your cat, who hates water, can swim
easily when she falls in. If you keep your wits as she does, you
will get along as well. Some people learn to swim just by trying by
themselves.</p>

<p>WORKING TO START HIS BREATHING AGAIN</p>
</div>
<p>If anyone in your party, when you are out boating or swimming,
should be nearly drowned, the best way to revive him is to lay him,
as quickly as possible, flat on his face on level <span class=
"pagenum"><a id="page145" name="page145"></a>145</span>ground, just
turning his head a little to one side so that his nose and mouth
will not be blocked. Then, kneeling astride of his legs, put both
your hands on the small of his back and press downward with all
your weight while you count three. This squeezes the abdomen and
the lower part of the chest so as to drive the air out of the
lungs. Then swing backward so as to take the weight off your hands,
while you count three again; and then swing forward again and press
down, again forcing the air out of the lungs. Keep up this
swing-pumping about ten or fifteen times a minute for at least ten
or fifteen minutes, unless the person begins to breathe of himself
before this. Don&rsquo;t waste any time trying to hold him up by
the feet, or roll him over a barrel so as to get the water out of
his lungs. Just turn him over on his <span class="pagenum"><a id=
"page146" name="page146"></a>146</span>face as quickly as possible
and get to work making a weight-pump of yourself on his back.</p>
<p>If there is any life left in the body at all when it is taken
out of the water, you will succeed in saving it. It is very seldom,
however, that anyone who has been under water more than five
minutes can be revived.</p>
<p>And now the thing that I want you to be sure to remember, I have
saved for the last. No matter what kind of accident happens, keep
your wits about you and keep cool. Be calm and <em>think</em> what
it is best to do, instead of letting yourself be frightened. Of
course, get some one to help you as soon as you can and, if need
be, call for help as loud as your lungs will let you. But use that
wonderful &ldquo;phone&rdquo; system to send in and out the
messages that will help you to help yourself by telling your

<p>One morning I stopped a moment on the street to speak to a
friend. Her little nephew had just finished eating some candy, and
down went his candy-bag on the pavement. His aunt happened to see
it. &ldquo;Oh, no, Claude,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;don&rsquo;t you
see the big green can there? Better put it into that.&rdquo; But
Claude was only three years old; and <span class="pagenum"><a id=
"page147" name="page147"></a>147</span>the can was so tall that he
could not tell what it was, till we led him up to it.</p>
<p>Do you have cans like these in your town, too? It is good to
think that every one of us, even such little fellows as Claude, can
help to keep the city beautiful. But it is not simply to make
things look nice that we have so many cans&mdash;cans for ashes,
cans for papers, cans for food scraps. No indeed, it is to keep the
city clean and make it fit for people to live in; for if dirty
papers and scraps were left to blow about the streets, they would
fill the air with germs and filth.</p>
<p>Any dust that blows about the streets is likely to be carrying
disease germs with it. That is why we have sprinklers driven
through the streets to wet them and to keep down the dust; and why,
in large cities, the streets are thoroughly flooded at night. If
the streets are kept damp and clean, then the air above them is
cool and fresh and pure.</p>
<p>How does the city get rid of all the dirt and waste? From every
house there are two kinds of waste. Some is taken away in pipes
from the sink and bathroom out into pipes that run under the
street, and these carry it away from the city to some stream or
deep water that takes it entirely away from the town.</p>
<p>The waste stuffs that are not watery, but <span class=
"pagenum"><a id="page148" name=
"page148"></a>148</span>solid&mdash;cabbage leaves, apple cores,
potato parings, and other scraps from the kitchen are carted away
and burned or fed to pigs. The ashes and tin cans are carted away,
also, and used in making new land or filling up hollow places.</p>
<p>Besides taking away the dirt, cities are careful to get clear,
pure drinking water. They are very, very careful about this; and
they usually have the water tested often, because, as you have
learned, even water that looks perfectly pure may give people
typhoid fever. That is why, when you are out in the country, on a
picnic perhaps, you must not drink from the streams. They may
receive the drainage from a farmer&rsquo;s barnyard, or the sewage
from some house.</p>
<p>The more we all learn about these things, the more careful will
the city be to protect her people. To be sure, most cities now have
Boards of Health who employ men and women to go about and see that
the food in the stores is clean&mdash;no flies, no dust, and no
tobacco smoke on it. They have laws, too, about keeping milk clean;
and in New York alone these laws have saved the lives of thousands
of babies. And they have laws about the care of streets and
buildings and cars and parks and a great many other things.</p>
<p>In all these things we have been talking about, <span class=
"pagenum"><a id="page149" name="page149"></a>149</span>I want you
to be thinking how you can help. For a city is made up of
people&mdash;boys and girls and men and women. The city is what its
people make it; and everyone must help, even the smallest children,
no older than little Claude.</p>
<p>The first and most important thing for you to do is to keep
yourself clean and tidy. And the next thing is for you to keep your
back yard as well as your front yard and the school yard and the
street free from papers and sticks and cans and old playthings. You
can put away your things when you are through playing; or, if you
are making a railroad or a town or a playhouse, you can leave it
looking nice and tidy. You can help chiefly by putting away your
own things. You know the old saying, &ldquo;A workman is known by
his chips&rdquo;; and a good workman always works in an orderly
way.</p>
<p>When you eat apples or bananas or oranges, don&rsquo;t throw the
skins or peelings about, but put them in a garbage can or swill
bucket or cover them with soft dirt in the garden or stable yard;
and don&rsquo;t throw peanut shells, or scraps of paper and the
like, about the streets or parks. You should begin to notice all
these things and talk about them, and that will make other people
begin to think about them, too.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page150" name=
"page150"></a>150</span>Then you can make gardens instead of
leaving bare, untidy back yards. I think that nicely kept vegetable
gardens are almost as pretty as flower gardens. If you cannot mow
the lawn, you can at least cut the long grass on the edges; and
that makes such a difference! It is wonderful how much boys and
girls can do in making and keeping a city really beautiful.</p>
<p>I hope that you have plenty of room to play in now. Of course,
when you grow up, you will see that there are plenty of playgrounds
and parks for the children. We are beginning to find out that the
richest and the most beautiful city is the one whose streets are
lined with families of happy, rosy-cheeked children. So, you see,
the &ldquo;City Beautiful&rdquo; is the one that takes best care of
her children, and she can do this only by keeping her streets and
houses perfectly clean and seeing that the food her people get is
fresh and good, and their drinking water pure. If the city or town
you live in is not like this, be sure you do your very best to make
it better.</p>

<p>OR LIKE THIS?</p>
</div>
<p>There is one great evil that for hundreds and hundreds of years
has been known wherever people are crowded together, and even in
the open country, too; and which has been the cause of more
untidiness and uncleanliness and unhappiness <span class=
"pagenum"><a id="page152" name="page152"></a>152</span>and disease
than any other evil ever known. And that is the drinking of
alcohol. People don&rsquo;t drink clear alcohol, but they can get a
great deal of it&mdash;enough to poison them badly&mdash;in the
fermented drinks you learned about some time ago.</p>
<p>In the days when your grandfather was a little boy, every man
thought that ale and wine and whiskey were good foods for him when
he was well; and good medicine when he was sick. He believed that
they gave him an appetite, and increased his strength. But now we
have found, by carefully studying the effects of alcohol, in
laboratories and in hospitals, that these beliefs were almost
entirely mistaken. We know that all that wine, beer, and whiskey do
is to make people feel better for a little while, without making
them actually stronger or better in any way. In fact, in most
respects these drinks make them weaker and worse instead.</p>
<p>Perhaps you will ask, &ldquo;How do whiskey and wine and beer do
us harm?&rdquo; And here is only part of the answer: (1) They tire
the heart and, by enlarging the blood pipes in the skin, make the
heart pump too much of the blood out to the skin. In this way they
make a person feel warmer when he really is not any warmer. (2)
They make the liver work too hard. (3) They dull the <span class=
"pagenum"><a id="page153" name="page153"></a>153</span>brain, so
that it cannot think so clearly or so well. (4) If one drinks them
frequently, it is harder for him to get well when he is sick; more
people die out of those who drink alcohol than out of those who do
not.</p>
<p>Alcohol is a <em>narcotic</em>; that is, it deadens our nerves,
for the time being, to any sensations of pain or discomfort, much
in the same way that a very small dose of <em>morphine</em> or
<em>opium</em> would. We may imagine it does us good because, for a
little while after drinking it, we may cease to feel pain or
fatigue or cold; but, instead of making us really better and able
to do more work, it is dulling our nerves so that we work more
slowly and more clumsily. Men who have carefully measured the
amount of work that they do have found that they do less work on
days when they take one or two glasses of beer or wine than they do
on days when they drink only water.</p>
<p>The great insurance companies have found that those of their
policy holders who drink no alcohol at all live nearly one fourth
longer and have nearly one third fewer sicknesses than those who
drink alcohol even in moderate amounts.</p>
<p>Indeed, so strong is the evidence as to the bad effects of
alcohol, and so steadily is it increasing, that it will probably
not be very many years <span class="pagenum"><a id="page154" name=
"page154"></a>154</span>more before the drinking of wine or beer by
intelligent, thoughtful people will have become less than half as
common as it is now.</p>
<p>Strong, healthy men may be able for a long time to drink small
amounts of liquor without noticing any harmful effects; but all the
time the alcohol may be doing serious harm to their nerves and
brain and kidneys and liver and blood vessels, which they will not
find out until it is too late to stop the trouble.</p>
<p>Useless and bad as alcohol is for full-grown men and women, it
is even worse for young and growing children; and no child, and no
boy or girl under the age of twenty-one, should ever touch a drop
of it, except in those rare instances where it may be prescribed as
a medicine by a doctor, just as many other drugs are, which in
larger doses would be poisons.</p>
<p>Fortunately, it will be no trouble for you children to let it
alone entirely; for not one of you would like the taste of it the
first time&mdash;or, indeed, for the matter of that, for the first
ten or twelve times&mdash;that you tried to drink it, if you should
be so foolish. This is one striking difference between alcohol and
all other foods and drinks. Children have absolutely no natural
liking, or taste, for the drinks that contain it, as <span class=
"pagenum"><a id="page155" name="page155"></a>155</span>they have
for meat, milk, sugar, apples, and the other real foods. This is
Nature&rsquo;s way of telling them that it is not a real food, and
not needed in any way for their growth and health. Let it alone
absolutely, until you are at least twenty-one years old; and by
that time you will probably have become so convinced of the harm
that it is doing that you will never begin using it at all.</p>
<p>What we have been saying so far applies, of course, only to the
moderate use of alcohol. How terrible the effects of the long or
excessive use of alcohol are, you don&rsquo;t need to learn from a
book. All you have to do is to keep your eyes open on the streets,
and see the drunken men reeling along the sidewalk, and the wrecks
of men that hang around the saloons. The poorhouses and the jails
and the insane asylums are filled with them. The most terrible
thing that can happen to anyone is to become a drunkard. The best
and safest and only sensible thing to do is to keep away from the
only stuff that makes drunkards. It may do you the most terrible
harm, and it cannot do you the slightest good.</p>
<p>Your city can never become the &ldquo;City Beautiful&rdquo; so
long as this evil mars it; and, as you grow up, I hope you will do
all you can toward making the right kind of city and home.</p>

<h2 id="Ch_7">THE EVENING MEAL</h2>
<p>When you have had some good games of play after school, and have
finished whatever errands you may have to run, or have done the
chores about the barn or the garden or the house, you will begin to
feel as if there were something missing somewhere. It won&rsquo;t
take you very long to discover where that missing feeling is; and
when you hear a call from the house, or a ring of the bell in the
hall, you come running in for supper. If you have worked well in
school and played hard and done your chores well, you will have a
splendid appetite. In fact, you will think there is no other meal
in the day that tastes quite so good.</p>
<p>Is your evening meal supper or dinner? If you have had a hot
dinner at noon, you probably do not want anything more than a good
supper. But if you had only luncheon, then you are ready to eat
something hot and hearty about six o&rsquo;clock.</p>
<p>What are some of the things that you like for dinner? Meat and
eggs and bread and butter and jam and rice and potatoes and onions
and celery and cookies and apples and oranges and oh, so many, many
other things! Mother Nature <span class="pagenum"><a id="page157"
name="page157"></a>157</span>has given us all these good things,
that we may have not only enough to eat but plenty of different
kinds. We soon grow tired of one kind, and that is how she tells us
that we need many kinds.</p>
<p>When I was little, oranges were not so common as they are now;
and I never but once had as many as I wanted. That once, my father
told me to eat all I liked, and I did; but for weeks afterwards I
didn&rsquo;t want even to see an orange! Did you ever feel that way
too, though perhaps not about oranges? Nature sometimes has to
teach us not to eat too much of one kind at a time.</p>
<p>Some people like one thing, and some another. Do all of you like
onions? I think not; but those who do, like them very much. The
same thing is true of tomatoes and sweet potatoes and red
raspberries and oysters and many other things. But there are some
things that almost everybody likes; and our grandfathers and
great-grandfathers and great-great-grandfathers ate them. One of
them is called the &ldquo;staff of life&rdquo; because we lean, or
depend, on it so much; we have it for breakfast, dinner, and
supper. That is bread, of course. Meat and eggs and milk and
butter, too, are among the foods that we all like.</p>
<p>These might be called our &ldquo;main foods,&rdquo; and we
should eat one or two or even three of them <span class=
"pagenum"><a id="page158" name="page158"></a>158</span>at each
meal. Meat and milk and eggs and butter, animals give us. But these
are not enough; we need besides some of the foods that plants give
us, because, as I have told you, we need different kinds of food at
one time to keep the body fires going briskly.</p>
<p>What are some of the foods that plants give us? Bread is made
from a plant&mdash;from wheat. Oatmeal comes from the oat plant;
and hominy, from corn. Some of our plant foods, such as potatoes,
turnips, onions, sweet potatoes, parsnips, and radishes, grow under
ground. Some, such as peas and beans, grow on vines. Then there are
lettuce and cabbage and celery. And there are
fruits&mdash;cherries, apples, peaches, plums, pears, melons,
tomatoes, berries.</p>
<p>Nature has given us all these foods, and many more; and she
wants us to use them all. She wants us to use, every day and every
meal, some foods that come from plants and some that come from
animals.</p>
<p>A good dinner would be a slice of roast beef or mutton, a
potato, a helping of some sort of vegetable like peas or beans or
onions or tomatoes or celery; and a dish of milk pudding or apple
dumpling, or stewed fruit with bread and butter, or pie that has
only an upper crust or its under <span class="pagenum"><a id=
"page159" name="page159"></a>159</span>crust very well baked. When
you are eating bread, remember that the crusts are the very best
part, because they are well cooked and really taste the best. They
are good for your teeth, too.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page160" name=

<p>ONE OF THE HAPPIEST TIMES OF THE DAY</p>
</div>
<p>Perhaps, while I am talking about a good meal, I ought to talk a
little about the way to eat and how to make mealtime pleasant.</p>
<p>Of course, to make our food soft, we must take little bites, eat
slowly, and chew each mouthful a long time. Be sure to remember
this. So many of the children I know eat so fast that you&rsquo;d
think they had to catch a train! Did you ever see anyone try to
talk and chew at the same time or forget to shut his mouth while he
was chewing? Wasn&rsquo;t it a very awkward, disagreeable sight?
Think a moment, if you are tempted to talk with your mouth full, or
put your knife into your mouth, or make a noise while you are
eating, that these things are not pleasant for your neighbors.</p>
<p>Do you tell funny stories at the table and talk about happy
tramps you have taken or games you have played, or about your pets
or your books? If you do, your food will do you more good, and you
will be helping the other people at the table, too. Mealtimes
should be the happiest times in the day.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page161" name=
"page161"></a>161</span></p>
<h2 id="Ch_8">A PLEASANT EVENING</h2>
<p>When the supper things have been cleared away, you have two
hours or so before going to bed, and I dare say you look forward to
these as one of the pleasantest parts of the day.</p>
<p>It is always best for you to take things rather easily and
quietly and pleasantly for at least fifteen or twenty minutes after
every meal; and after the heaviest meal of the day, whether this
comes at noon or in the evening, it is better to stretch the time
to half or three quarters of an hour. If you try to work or play
hard right after a hearty meal, you will be drawing away to your
brain or to your muscles, the blood that the stomach is trying to
get for the digesting and melting of your food. I suppose that you
have all found this out for yourselves; for, if you run and play
too hard right after dinner, you are very soon out of breath, and
if you keep up the exercise, you are quite likely to have an attack
of indigestion or stomach ache. If you sit down to study directly
after a meal, you soon feel heavy and lazy, and what you read
doesn&rsquo;t seem clear to you, and in a little while you probably
have <span class="pagenum"><a id="page162" name=
"page162"></a>162</span>a headache and an unpleasant taste in your
mouth. If you try to do two important things like digestion and
hard work with your brain or the muscles of your arms and legs at
the same time, you will be very likely to do both of them
badly.</p>
<p>Even if you have studying to do at night, it will be much better
for you to spend half an hour or an hour in laughing and chatting,
or in reading some good story, or in playing some of the many
pleasant parlor games that rest you instead of tiring you, before
you settle down to your books. You will find that when you do start
to work, you get your lessons much more quickly and easily than if
you had started in after eating.</p>
<p>Perhaps your sister is just waiting to show you that girls can
play checkers better than boys can&mdash;&ldquo;So there!&rdquo; Or
some of your friends have come in for a game of dominoes or authors
or snap or parcheesi or stage coach or pussy-wants-a-corner, or to
try that new song you learned last week; and you will be surprised
how quickly the time flies away and bedtime or study hour
comes.</p>
<p>Most evenings, however, you will probably get out your favorite
magazine, or that good story that you are reading, and you will all
sit <span class="pagenum"><a id="page163" name=
"page163"></a>163</span>around the big lamp on the center table and
go off on adventures to the uttermost parts of the earth, with the
best and most lasting friends that you will ever make&mdash;friends
who will never grow tired of you and will always come when you want
them and are always willing to talk or play&mdash;the people that
live in books. Be sure to pick out the best of them for your
chums&mdash;the bravest and the kindest and the most courteous, and
the cleanest and the most honorable. You have the whole world to
choose from; and it is never worth your while to get acquainted
with cheap, badly behaved, second-rate people when you can have
your pick of the best. Your mother and your father and your teacher
will help you to choose, and you will soon find that what they call
&ldquo;good literature&rdquo; is good stories, and about the right
sort of men and women and boys and girls&mdash;the kind that you
would like to know, and that you would want to be like. Once try
it, and you find that you like that kind of reading better than you
do the cheap, slangy, trashy stuff, just as you like, and never get
tired of, good bread and butter and roast beef and apples and milk
and cream and pudding and pie. Good sound stories of home life and
adventure and travel are just as important in making <span class=
"pagenum"><a id="page164" name="page164"></a>164</span>your minds
wholesome and happy as these good foods are in keeping your bodies
strong and healthy.</p>
<p>Be sure that the paper of the books and magazines you read is
white and <em>not</em> glossy, and is fairly thick and firm; for
this makes them much easier to read and strains your eyes less.
See, too, that the type is large and clear; for small, close type
and yellow or shiny paper are very hard on the eyes.</p>
<p>Be sure, of course, when you sit down to read <em>not</em> to
sit with your face to the lamp and your head bending forward; but
settle yourself in a comfortable chair with your back to the light,
and hold your book so that you can keep your chin up and your head
erect while you read. You can breathe better, and read better, and
enjoy what you read better in this position than in any other.</p>
<p>Even if you have sums or writing to do, it is better to sit with
your back, or at least your left side, toward the light; and often
you will find it a great help to sit down with your back to the
light in a large easy chair and do your writing on a big, thin
book, or light piece of board, on a cushion on your knee.</p>
<p>In winter, you will find that for the first half <span class=
"pagenum"><a id="page165" name="page165"></a>165</span>hour or so
that you are reading after supper, you will want to keep fairly
near the fire, because the blood is being drawn in from your skin
to your stomach for purposes of digestion; but be sure to see that
at least one, and better two, windows in the room are open six
inches or so at the top, so that there is plenty of fresh air
pouring into the room.</p>

<p>A COZY NOOK WHEN EVENING COMES</p>
</div>
<p>When study hour comes, take up your books and go briskly to
work, forgetting that there is anything else in the world, and you
will be astonished how quickly you will learn your lessons.
Besides, you will be learning one of the most valuable lessons in
life&mdash;to do with your might whatever your hands, or minds,
find to do.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page166" name=

<h2 id="Ch_9">GOOD NIGHT</h2>
<h3 id="Ch_9_1">I. GETTING READY FOR BED</h3>
<p>By and by the clock strikes eight or nine, and your mother says,
&ldquo;Children, time to go to bed!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sometimes you will have just come to the interesting point in
the story, and would give anything to go on and finish it. But
often you will be just nodding over your book, or beginning to
wonder why the story is not quite so interesting as it was, or why
the lines seem to be running into one another, and the book
inclined to swing up and bump your nose.</p>
<p>If you have had a lively, busy, happy day, you are quite sleepy
enough to be ready for bed&mdash;that is, if you could drop into it
with all your clothes on, without all the bother and fuss of
undressing. So you pull yourself together bravely and answer,
&ldquo;All right, mother,&rdquo; and say &ldquo;Good night&rdquo;
to everybody, and upstairs you go.</p>
<p>Of course, you must take off your clothes, because you would
find them most uncomfortable to sleep in. Besides, the little pores
all over your skin have been pouring out perspiration all day long;
and a great deal of this has been <span class="pagenum"><a id=
"page167" name="page167"></a>167</span>caught by your clothes, just
as it is caught by the bedclothes while you sleep.</p>
<p>So it is a good thing to take off your clothes, and let your
skin be well aired and cooled. Don&rsquo;t leave your clothes all
in a heap on the floor just where you happen to shed them, but hang
them up over the back of a chair or on pegs, so that the air can
blow through them all night long and sweeten and clean and dry
them. Clothes that are worn continuously become sour with
perspiration, and for this same reason your mother gives you
regularly, once or twice a week, clean underwear and clean shirts
or dresses.</p>
<p>After you have undressed for bed, wash your face and neck and
hands; and if you have a nice warm room or bathroom, take a quick
splash, or sponge bath, all over, before you put on your nightgown.
This will wash away from your skin everything that the perspiration
has been leaving on it all day long, as well as any dust, or dirt,
that may have got on it during the day.</p>
<p>If the room is not warm enough for you to do this, it is a good
thing for you to strip to your waist and then to swing your arms
about, much as you did in the morning, only not quite so long, and
to rub your arms and neck and shoulders all over with your hands.
This gives them an <span class="pagenum"><a id="page168" name=
"page168"></a>168</span><em>air bath</em>, and rubs off any of the
little scales of skin that may be ready to be shed, and gives you a
sort of dry wash, which is next best to a wet one.</p>
<p>Then, when you have put on your nightdress, give your hair a
thorough brushing. This is the best time of the day to do it. Dust,
smoke, soot, and germs have been blowing into your hair all day
long, and a thoroughly good brushing will not only get these out of
it before they have had time to work their way in and lodge on the
scalp, but will keep the hair bright and healthy.</p>
<p>Before you get into bed, give your nails a quick scrub with a
nail brush and hot water and soap, and go over them with a
<em>blunt</em>-pointed nail cleaner, cleaning out any dirt that may
be under their edges, and rounding off any ragged or broken points
with the file. Once a week or so, when you take your hot bath, it
is a good thing to go over your toe nails in the same way, trimming
them and cleaning them. Remember, however, not to round off your
toe nails at the corners, but to leave them square, as in this way
you will prevent them from ingrowing under the pressure of your
shoes.</p>
<p>There is one thing that you should be very sure of before you
get into bed, and that is that <span class="pagenum"><a id=
"page169" name="page169"></a>169</span>your teeth are as clean as
it is possible for you to make them. If you attended to this also
directly after supper, so much the better; for just as it is
important to clean the dishes and knives and forks that you have
been using, so it is important to thoroughly clean the ivory knives
and forks that grow in your mouth. Talk about being &ldquo;born
with a silver spoon in your mouth&rdquo;! You were born with
something much prettier and far more valuable.</p>
<p>Even though your teeth make a firm and even line in front and on
their cutting edges, yet there are many little gaps and spaces
between their roots, where bits of food can stick. If these scraps
of food are not thoroughly and carefully removed after each meal,
the warmth and moisture in the mouth makes them begin to decay. The
acids from this decay will be likely not only to upset your stomach
and digestion, but to act upon the glassy coating of your teeth.
After a little while, spots will begin to form on the surface of
your teeth; they will lose their bright, shiny, pearly look; the
acids will eat further into the teeth, and very soon there will be
holes, or <em>cavities</em>.</p>
<div class="figleft"><img src="images/figure54.png" alt=

<p>HEALTHY GUMS MEAN HEALTHY TEETH</p>
<p class="morecaption">If the gums are not kept clean and healthy,
the second teeth that are getting ready to push out the first teeth
will not come in strong and good, nor will the teeth remain good.
This picture shows how the teeth grow. Notice the gaps between the
teeth, where food may lodge.</p>
</div>
<p>Though your teeth are very hard and glassy looking on the
surface, they are much softer and chalkier inside; this glassy
coating covers only <span class="pagenum"><a id="page170" name=
"page170"></a>170</span>the <em>crown</em>, or free part, of the
tooth, which you can see. It leaves the softer inside part of the
tooth bare just at the edge of the gums, and particularly between
the roots of the teeth, where little scraps of food lodge and
decay. When the acids that are formed by the decaying food have
eaten away a good deal of the inside of the tooth, the hard, shiny
surface is left just like a thin shell; and one day you happen to
bite down upon a piece of bone in your food, or try to crack a nut
with your teeth, and &ldquo;crack&rdquo; goes this brittle shell of
your hollow tooth.</p>
<p>Right in the middle of each tooth is a tiny hollow, or cavity,
filled with a soft, living pulp containing one or two very
sensitive nerves; and when the decay has eaten into the tooth far
enough to reach this nerve pulp, it makes it ache, and then you
have <em>toothache</em>.</p>
<p>The one and only thing that is necessary in <span class=
"pagenum"><a id="page171" name="page171"></a>171</span>order to
avoid all this decay and breaking away of your teeth, and throbbing
toothache, is to keep the surface of your teeth, and particularly
the sides where they are next one another, clean and smooth and
unbroken. And all that is needed to keep your teeth perfectly clean
and smooth is to use your toothbrush thoroughly after every meal
and at bedtime; and then, if there are any little scraps of food
between the teeth that have not been brushed away, to pick them out
gently with a quill toothpick, or take a piece of silk or linen
thread, push it up between the teeth, and gently saw backward and
forward until you have cleaned out the space between the roots. You
should take at least three to five minutes after every meal and
before you go to bed at night to brush your teeth; and you should
brush not only your teeth, but the whole surface of your gums close
up to where they join the lips.</p>
<p>It is almost as important to keep your gums pink and hard and
healthy as it is to keep your teeth clean; and the same thorough
brushing will do both. If the gums are perfectly healthy, they will
come well down over the roots of the teeth, and keep them safely
covered right down to where the glassy outer coating begins, and so
leave no gap where the acids of decay can attack <span class=
"pagenum"><a id="page172" name="page172"></a>172</span>the teeth.
Be sure to brush your teeth, not merely straight backward and
forward, but up and down and round and round as well, both to clean
out thoroughly all the grooves and openings between them and to
brush the gums well down over the teeth.</p>
<p>It may seem strange, but one of the best ways to keep your teeth
from growing crooked and irregular is to keep your nose clear and
healthy, so that you can breathe through it freely at all times,
both day and night. Crooked jaws and irregular teeth are more often
caused by mouth breathing than by any other one thing.</p>
<p>You can see why it is best to be careful not to get grit or dirt
or bits of bone in your food, and not to crack nuts or hard candy
with your teeth. If you do, you may crack or scratch the delicate
glassy coating of your teeth. But, on the other hand, it is a good
thing to give the teeth plenty to do, and particularly to eat the
crusts of bread, and some of the tougher parts of meat, and parched
corn or other grains, and to eat celery, apples, and other foods
that take a great deal of chewing. The teeth are like everything
else in the body&mdash;they need plenty of vigorous work in order
to keep them healthy.</p>
<p>Be very careful, though, to keep out of your <span class=
"pagenum"><a id="page173" name="page173"></a>173</span>mouth
anything that might possibly crack or scratch the glassy coating,
such as pins, pennies, pieces of wire, or slate pencils. It is best
not even to try to bite off threads or pieces of string. There is,
of course, another reason for not putting pencils and pennies and
such things into your mouth: they may have dirt, or germs, on them
and infect you with disease or at least upset your digestion.</p>
<h3 id="Ch_9_2">II. THE LAND OF NOD</h3>
<p>Now you are all ready for bed; and the white pillow and the
nice, clean sheets and the warm blankets look very good to you, and
you are ready to go to the &ldquo;Land of Nod.&rdquo;</p>
<p>You need not be afraid of the cold at night. Open your bedroom
windows. Have plenty of light-weight, warm covers; then the cold
breezes won&rsquo;t hurt you, but will make you strong. Just think
how many hours you are in bed,&mdash;nearly half of your
life,&mdash;and you need fresh, moving air all the time. Be sure to
open your windows from the top as well as from the bottom. You know
why: your breath is warm so that it floats and rises like smoke;
and if you open the window only at the bottom, this bad air, which
rises to the top of the room, can&rsquo;t get out. It is best to
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page174" name=
"page174"></a>174</span>have windows on two sides of a bedroom, so
that the air can be kept moving through it all night long. If you
don&rsquo;t breathe fresh air while you sleep, you will feel dull
and stupid in the morning and perhaps have a headache.</p>
<p>So run your window shades right up to the top and throw your
curtains, or shutters, back, as well as open the windows. If you
don&rsquo;t, the fresh air cannot blow through the room properly.
Even if this does let more light or noise into the room, this is of
no importance whatever compared with abundance of fresh air. If you
have played long enough out of doors in the daytime and have eaten
a good supper and not stayed up too late, you will sleep soundly
without being bothered at all by either lights or noises coming in
through the windows. And no matter how cold or how light it is,
don&rsquo;t put your head under the bedclothes. Why?</p>
<p>It is best for you to close your mouth while you are going to
sleep, and breathe through your nose, so that the air will be
properly purified and warmed before it reaches your lungs. If you
can&rsquo;t do this, your mother can perhaps give you something to
wash out your nose, so that you can breathe freely. If that does
not help, you had better see a doctor, and he will find some way
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page175" name=
"page175"></a>175</span>to clear your head so that you can use your
nose comfortably.</p>
<p>Suppose you take a pencil and paper and write down all you did
yesterday. Wasn&rsquo;t it enough to make you tired and sleepy and
want a chance to rest? Even while you sleep, your heart keeps
beating, and you don&rsquo;t stop breathing, of course. But your
muscles are quiet, and your food tube rests. Your brain rests,
too,&mdash;better in sleep than at any other time,&mdash;so that
when morning comes you are as &ldquo;lively as a cricket&rdquo; and
quite ready for the new day.</p>
<p>Yet even in sleep your brain does not stop working entirely, but
goes on receiving messages from the stomach and the skin and the
memory, and mixing them up together in the strangest fashion, so
that you <em>dream</em>, as you say. You ought not to dream very
much if you are perfectly well; but as long as your dreams are
pleasant or amusing, you need not pay any attention to them. But if
you have had bad dreams, or you dream so hard all night long that
you don&rsquo;t feel rested in the morning, then you had better
speak to your mother about it, and let her see what is the matter
with your digestion or your nerves, or take you to a doctor. Bad
dreams are always a sign of ill health and are a very disagreeable
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page176" name=
"page176"></a>176</span>thing, from which there is no need that you
should suffer any more than from headache or indigestion or colic.
Dreams, of course, do not mean or foretell anything whatever,
except simply how bad, or good, the state of your digestion and
your nerves is.</p>
<p>Now, how much time should you spend in bed? Well, I think at
your age nearly half the time. Ten or eleven hours of sleep make
you ready for all the hours of work and play, and you don&rsquo;t
become cross and tired half so easily if you have plenty of sleep.
Though you are lying so quietly, you are not by any means wasting
your time, for you probably are growing faster when you are asleep
than when awake. Babies, who are growing very fast, you know, sleep
nearly all the time.</p>
<p>So after you have opened all the windows wide, put out the light
and jump into bed and lie down for a good night&rsquo;s rest
without thinking about anything except how comfortable the bed
feels when you are tired.</p>

<li>Are you careful to keep your breath as clean as possible? How?
How do you help keep the air in your house clean?</li>
</ol>
<h3>In School</h3>
<h4>I. Bringing the Fresh Air In.</h4>
<ol>
<li>What do we mean by fresh air? Why must the air we breathe have
oxygen in it?</li>
<li>Is the air in the room now the best you can have in it? How is
the air moving?</li>

</ol>
<h4>II. Hearing and Listening.</h4>
<ol>

notice whenever a heavy train went by? What made the bed
tremble?</li>
<li>If you have stood very near a moving train, how did your ears
feel? Why?</li>
<li>How far do sound waves travel after they enter the ear? Could a
person be deaf who had two perfect ears? Where would the trouble
be?</li>
<li>Draw a picture to show the parts of your <em>left</em> ear, and
name each part.</li>
<li>How do you take care of your ears?</li>
<li>Comment on doing each of these things:&mdash;firing a bean
shooter at anyone; throwing gravel or sand; firing off a cap or
torpedo close to some one&rsquo;s head; boxing a person on the ear;
running a nail cleaner or pencil point into your ear; putting on
the baby&rsquo;s cap so that the ears are folded forward; asking
your teacher to repeat her question.</li>
<li>Have you tried to train your ears? How?&mdash;and why?</li>
<li>Find out about some business, or occupation, in which it is
necessary to have very keen hearing, and write a little story about
it.</li>
</ol>
<h4>III. Seeing and Reading.</h4>
<ol>
<li>Are you seated now in the best way for reading or not?

<ol>
<li>Why do we want to drink water? How would you know that your
body must have a great deal of liquid in it?</li>
<li>Do you know where the water you drink at school comes from? If
you don&rsquo;t, try to find out; and find out also just how it is
brought to the school and why it flows up to the faucets.</li>
<li>If you get drinking water from a well, either at home or at
school, tell where this well is&mdash;how near the house or the
out-buildings. Do you think that any waste from these buildings
could drain into the well? Why?</li>
<li>At your sand table or from a sandpile in the yard, lay out a
farmyard, showing where the house, the barn, the chicken yard, and
the pig-sty, also the privy vault, are. Now locate the well so that
it cannot receive drainage from any of these places.</li>
<li>What is the danger in using drinking water from a stream?</li>
<li>How could the germs of typhoid fever get into the milk we
drink?</li>

</ol>
<h4>V. Little Cooks.</h4>
<ol>
<li>Do you bring luncheon to school? What do you like to have for
your luncheon? Talk about this in class with your teacher, and find
out what things are best for school luncheons.</li>
<li>How is your luncheon packed? Why ought it to be neatly
done?</li>
<li>How long do you take for luncheon, or for dinner at home? Is
this time enough?</li>
<li>What do you do right after eating? Is this what you ought to
do? Why?</li>
<li>What foods do you know how to cook? Write out the recipe for
something you have made, showing what you mixed and how you did it;
and in what, and how long, you cooked it.</li>
<li>Give three reasons for cooking food.</li>
<li>How is fried food so often made indigestible?</li>
<li>Are sweet foods good or harmful? What does sugar come from? How
is it made?</li>
<li>Write a little story about one of these things: My First Lesson
in Cooking; Our Taffy Party; How I Kept Flies out of the Kitchen;
How We Boys Cooked Breakfast (or Supper); My Marketing.</li>
</ol>
<h4>VI. Tasting and Smelling.</h4>
<ol>
<li>If anyone asked you how a lemon tastes, what would you say?
What would you say about sugar? Salt? Pepper? Pickles?
Strawberries? Cheese? Onions? Radishes? How did you learn about
each of these?</li>
<li>What does your tongue do besides receiving tastes? Note in the
picture (<a href="#page86">p. 86</a>) how strongly your tongue is
rooted; point to the tip of it in the picture.</li>
<li>How does your nose help your throat and your lungs? How else
may it help you?</li>
<li>Draw a picture to show how air reaches the lungs.</li>
<li>What are <em>adenoids</em>? How may you know if you have
adenoids? If you have, what ought you to do? Why?</li>
<li>Where do the men who want to smoke in the open trolley car have
to sit? Why? If children breathe tobacco smoke, what effect will it
have on them? Why is smoking a foolish habit? How is it often
harmful?</li>
</ol>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="page181" name=
"page181"></a>181</span></p>
<h4>VII. Talking and Reciting.</h4>
<ol>
<li>When you are reciting in class, do you think how your voice and
the words sound to the other people in the room? Show the class how
you can make your speech sound just as you want it to.</li>
<li>Give three ways in which you can take care of your throat and
voice. Put your hand on the place where your voice is made. How is
it made?</li>
<li>On your own picture of the throat, show where those little
folds of skin are (the picture on <a href="#page86">p. 86</a>
shows, of course, only the fold of skin, or <em>vocal cord</em>, on
the right half of the windpipe).</li>
</ol>
<h4>VIII. Thinking and Answering.</h4>
<ol>
<li>With two or three of your classmates, play telephone;&mdash;one
must be &ldquo;Central&rdquo; and one &ldquo;Information&rdquo; at
the central office, and one must receive your message and answer
it. A number of the other children may join hands to make a long
&ldquo;wire&rdquo; on each side of &ldquo;Central&rdquo;; they will
repeat the message softly from one to another all down their
&ldquo;wire.&rdquo;</li>
<li>Now, suppose that you all represent the telephone system in the
body. Could you act out this &ldquo;Body-Telephone&rdquo;
call:&mdash;The eye sees a burning match on the floor, and sends
the message to its center in the brain; this center consults the
memory (&ldquo;Information&rdquo;) as to what to do. Memory recalls
that burning matches are likely to set fire to other things and
ought to be put out. So the brain sends a message to the muscles of
the foot to get to work and stamp out the flame. In this play, what
will you each call yourselves?</li>
<li>Make up some other &ldquo;Body-Telephone&rdquo; plays.</li>
<li>What are some of the messages that are being carried by your
nerves, that you know nothing about?</li>
<li>Think how many messages a baby stores away before he is ready
to answer them; what are some of these? Why can he not answer them
at once? What makes his brain and nerves and muscles grow? How can
you take the best care of yours?</li>
<li>In the picture on <a href="#page96">p. 96</a>, point to the
brain; to the spinal cord. How near the surface of your back is
your spinal cord? What keeps it from being easily injured?</li>
</ol>
<h3>&ldquo;Absent To-day?&rdquo;</h3>
<h4>I. Keeping Well.</h4>
<ol>
<li>Why do our bodies need &ldquo;housecleaning&rdquo;? How do we
get rid of the waste part that is a gas? Of the part that is water?
What carries the carbon dioxid to the lungs? What carries the waste
water to the sweat tubes and the kidneys? What other waste is there
to be gotten rid of?</li>
<li>Suppose that you and your chum each have an equal chance to
take a bad cold from someone else; your chum catches it, and you
don&rsquo;t. What might be one reason why you don&rsquo;t? Place
your hand over your liver. How can you keep it in good working
order?</li>
<li>What is the bladder? Why is it so very necessary to empty the
bladder regularly? When you perspire freely, how does that help the
kidneys?</li>
</ol>
<h4>II. Some Foes to Fight.</h4>
<ol>
<li>You have seen moldy bread? What is, the mold? What makes it
spread?</li>
<li>Suppose you take some pieces of moldy bread or potato and turn
a glass jar or bowl over them. Catch a few flies and put them under
the glass, and leave them to crawl over the <span class=
"pagenum"><a id="page182" name="page182"></a>182</span>moldy food.
After a day, put the flies under another glass with some pieces of
fresh bread or potato. If you find that the fresh food quickly
becomes moldy, how will you think that the mold germs came to it?
(If you keep the jars in a warm place, the germs will grow faster,
and you won&rsquo;t have so long to wait before you can see the
mold.)</li>
<li>What other kinds of germs do flies carry? How do they carry

or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work

     License.  You must require such a user to return or

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
